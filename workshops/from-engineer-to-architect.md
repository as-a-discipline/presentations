## Thinking Like an Architect: Transitioning from Developer to Software

Moving from software developer to architect requires a shift in mindset and skills. In this 8-hour workshop, you’ll learn how to decompose complex requirements, diagram systems at different altitudes, and understand which modeling languages are most effective for communicating architectural decisions. We’ll also cover how to assess and de-risk projects with strategic foresight.

The first portion of the workshop will feature lecture-style learning through real-world examples, introducing core concepts in architectural thinking. In the second portion, we’ll dive into Architectural Katas—a proven method for practicing and refining architectural skills. Participants will engage in a short kata exercise, then pair up for peer review, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

This workshop is designed for experienced developers aiming to expand their influence and impact as solution architects or tech leads. You’ll leave with practical techniques, hands-on experience, and the confidence to think and lead like an architect.

# SECTION #1
# What is Software Architecture?


<!-- 
This is the section introduction slide to topic. Reinforce the title: with something like 'Defining Software Architecture.' 
Set the stage by telling participants that the definition of architecture is more nuanced and layered than most people think. 
Encourage attendees to think beyond just diagrams or system components.

Ask the room: What does architecture mean to you?
