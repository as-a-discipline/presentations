title: Architecture as a Discipline - What is Architecture?
description: |
  Moving from software developer to architect requires a shift in mindset and skills. In this 8-hour workshop, you'll learn how to decompose complex requirements, 
  diagram systems at different altitudes, and understand which modeling languages are most effective for communicating architectural decisions. We'll also 
  cover how to assess and de-risk projects with strategic foresight.
  
  The first portion of the workshop will feature lecture-style learning through real-world examples, introducing core concepts in architectural thinking. 
  In the second portion, we'll dive into Architectural Katasâ€”a proven method for practicing and refining architectural skills. Participants will engage in 
  a short kata exercise, then pair up for peer review, fostering a collaborative learning environment. This workshop is designed for experienced developers aiming 
  to expand their influence and impact as solution architects or tech leads. You'll leave with practical techniques, hands-on experience, and the confidence to 
  think and lead like an architect.
