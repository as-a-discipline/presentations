# ⚡ Recognizing the Inflection Point

<!-- 
This section helps engineers recognize the subtle moment when they begin practicing architecture—often before a title change.
Encourage reflection on influence, ownership, and the expanding scope of responsibility.
This is the moment when architecture becomes a visible skill, not just a hidden mindset.

# ⚡ Recognizing the Inflection Point

- The shift to architecture starts with how you think—not with a new title  
<!-- 
It’s not about promotions. 
It’s about noticing that your decisions impact systems, not just features. 
Architecture begins when your thinking expands beyond the local to the systemic.

# ⚡ Recognizing the Inflection Point

- The shift to architecture starts with how you think—not with a new title  
- You begin solving problems that span teams, systems, and domains  
<!-- 
The issues aren’t in one repo—they’re in how services communicate, how tools scale, or how teams coordinate. 
This is when engineering gives way to architectural concern.

# ⚡ Recognizing the Inflection Point

- The shift to architecture starts with how you think—not with a new title  
- You begin solving problems that span teams, systems, and domains  
- You’re relied on for judgment—not just implementation  
<!-- 
Peers start asking for your input on trade-offs or designs you didn’t write. 
You’re no longer just a contributor—you’re an influencer, even if unofficially.

- The shift to architecture starts with how you think—not with a new title  
- You begin solving problems that span teams, systems, and domains  
- You’re relied on for judgment—not just implementation  
- Your scope of ownership expands, often without formal authority  
<!-- 
You may feel stretched—making big decisions without big titles. 
That’s normal. This is the proving ground. 
Your thinking is ahead of your role—and that’s how roles catch up.

<!-- 
The inflection point isn’t about being chosen—it’s about showing up differently. 
Notice it. Embrace it. Use it. 
This is where architecture begins—in influence, not in hierarchy.
