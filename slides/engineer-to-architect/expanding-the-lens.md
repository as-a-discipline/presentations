# 🔍 Expanding the Lens: From Code to Context

<!-- 
This section explores the mindset shift from local implementation to systemic awareness.
It marks the beginning of architectural thinking—when engineers start asking not just “how” but “why.”
Encourage the audience to view software as shaped by context, not just code.

# 🔍 Expanding the Lens: From Code to Context

- Architecture begins where implementation meets environment  
<!-- 
This shift is subtle: it’s not abandoning code—it’s situating it.
You begin to see that how code is written is shaped by where and why it’s written.

# 🔍 Expanding the Lens: From Code to Context

- Architecture begins where implementation meets environment  
- You begin asking “why,” not just “how”  
<!-- 
Why does this requirement exist? 
Why does this solution fail under scale?
Why do teams keep duplicating effort? 
These questions lead you beyond syntax and into systems.

# 🔍 Expanding the Lens: From Code to Context

- Architecture begins where implementation meets environment  
- You begin asking “why,” not just “how”  
- You see patterns in decision-making, not just in code  
<!-- 
Architects notice fragility in workflows and coordination, not just in functions and classes.
They understand how decisions ripple through teams and timelines.

- Architecture begins where implementation meets environment  
- You begin asking “why,” not just “how”  
- You see patterns in decision-making, not just in code  
- You observe systems from multiple perspectives  
<!-- 
You ask: How does this design affect the user? The ops team? Integration partners? 
You build empathy across roles—which enables better systems.

- Architecture begins where implementation meets environment  
- You begin asking “why,” not just “how”  
- You see patterns in decision-making, not just in code  
- You observe systems from multiple perspectives  
- Expanding your lens deepens—not replaces—your engineering  
<!-- 
This isn’t about leaving code behind.
It’s about connecting it to meaning.
When you understand context, your engineering becomes more powerful—and more relevant.

<!-- 
Architects don’t just shape code—they shape the conditions under which code succeeds.
Looking up and out is the first step toward designing with purpose.
That’s how engineering becomes architecture.
