# 🧠 Core Skills to Develop

<!-- 
This section outlines the essential skills engineers must cultivate to operate effectively as architects.
These are not soft skills—they are enabling capabilities that allow architecture to scale, align, and endure.
Encourage the audience to treat these as core—not optional—parts of architectural development.

# 🧠 Core Skills to Develop

- Abstraction and decomposition turn complexity into clarity  
<!-- 
Architects don’t just solve problems—they shape them into forms others can solve.
Decomposition, cohesion, and boundary design are the essence of architecture as enablement.
