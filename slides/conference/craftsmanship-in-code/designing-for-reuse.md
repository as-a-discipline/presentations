# 🔁 Designing for Reuse, Not Repetition

<!-- 
This section explores how to recognize patterns worth reusing and avoid the trap of premature abstraction.
True reuse supports change without enforcing rigidity. The mindset here is “validate before generalizing.”

# 🔁 Designing for Reuse, Not Repetition

- Rule of 3: Don’t generalize before pattern proves out  
<!-- Explain the Rule of 3: don’t abstract until you’ve implemented a solution three times.
It’s a safeguard against designing for imagined futures. -->

# 🔁 Designing for Reuse, Not Repetition

- Rule of 3: Don’t generalize before pattern proves out  
- Risks of premature abstraction  
<!-- Premature abstraction increases indirection and often hides intent.
Instead of enabling reuse, it hardcodes assumption. Reuse must earn its place. -->

# 🔁 Designing for Reuse, Not Repetition

- Rule of 3: Don’t generalize before pattern proves out  
- Risks of premature abstraction  
- Reuse patterns: Adapter  
<!-- Adapter pattern allows reuse *without* distortion.
It respects differing models and creates a translation layer instead of forced alignment. -->

- Rule of 3: Don’t generalize before pattern proves out  
- Risks of premature abstraction  
- Reuse patterns: Adapter  
- Reuse patterns: Shared libraries with version control  
<!-- Reuse is only sustainable when it’s versioned.
Without versioning, shared libraries create coupling, not collaboration. -->

- Reuse patterns: Adapter  
- Reuse patterns: Shared libraries with version control  
- Reuse patterns: Template method vs. policy injection  
<!-- Template Method locks in flow but allows variation.
Policy injection keeps the host generic and delegates logic. Choose based on how much control the reuse needs. -->

<!-- Leave the audience with caution: not all repetition is waste.
Craft means choosing when to repeat and when to reuse, based on evidence, not habit. -->
