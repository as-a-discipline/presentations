# 🔄 Designing for Adaptability

<!-- 
This section focuses on how to build software that expects and embraces change.
Adaptability is a core trait of sustainable systems—these practices create space for growth without rework.
The mindset: Assume change is coming. Design like you know where flexibility matters most.

- Temporal decoupling (queues, schedulers)  
<!-- Decouple producers and consumers through async mechanisms.
Queues and schedulers create resilience and allow systems to evolve independently. -->

# 🔄 Designing for Adaptability

- Temporal decoupling (queues, schedulers)  
- Feature toggles for runtime safety  
<!-- Use toggles to release safely, test incrementally, and decouple deployment from exposure.
Adaptability means testing new paths before committing to them. -->

- Feature toggles for runtime safety  
- API and schema versioning  
<!-- Evolution is inevitable—versioning is how you make it survivable.
Maintain compatibility while preparing for change. -->
