<!-- 
This section establishes the deeper definition of software craftsmanship—not just clean code,
but durable design. It reframes engineering as a long-term, system-oriented discipline.
The audience should reflect on their own habits and whether they optimize for aesthetics or endurance.

<!-- Wrap with the idea that craftsmanship is not just about the code, but the context it creates for others.
This sets the tone for exploring patterns and structures that embody those values. -->
