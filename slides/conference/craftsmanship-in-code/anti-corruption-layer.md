# 🧱 Anti-Corruption Layers (ACL)

<!-- 
This section introduces one of the most critical patterns for system integrity: the Anti-Corruption Layer.
It's how we create safe boundaries between legacy and new, external and internal. It’s a strategy of protection and translation.
The audience should see ACLs not as overhead, but as essential architectural armor.

# 🧱 Anti-Corruption Layers (ACL)

- Define ACL (from DDD)  
<!-- Introduce the concept as defined in Domain-Driven Design.
An ACL is a protective translation layer between two bounded contexts or systems. -->

# 🧱 Anti-Corruption Layers (ACL)

- Define ACL (from DDD)  
- Purpose: Shield new systems from legacy  
<!-- Emphasize that ACLs prevent legacy design compromises from infecting new architectures.
They're the quarantine zone of system design. -->

# 🧱 Anti-Corruption Layers (ACL)

- Define ACL (from DDD)  
- Purpose: Shield new systems from legacy  
- Purpose: Translate external models into internal ones  
<!-- Point out that this translation is not just data—it includes terminology, semantics, and business rules. -->

# 🧱 Anti-Corruption Layers (ACL)

- Define ACL (from DDD)  
- Purpose: Shield new systems from legacy  
- Purpose: Translate external models into internal ones  
- Use cases: legacy escape, bounded context protection, vendor insulation

<!-- Summarize: ACLs aren't just for legacy—they're a design investment for future change.
They allow systems to evolve independently while still interoperating. -->
