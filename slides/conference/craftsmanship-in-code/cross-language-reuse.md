# 🌐 Cross-Language Reuse Strategies

<!-- 
This section focuses on architectural alignment across polyglot systems.
It introduces strategies that allow teams to reuse behavior through shared contracts rather than shared codebases.
The mindset here is interoperability over uniformity.

# 🌐 Cross-Language Reuse Strategies

- Shared Contract > Shared Code  
<!-- Shared contracts create interoperability without enforcing language or stack conformity.
They become the interface glue across services. -->

# 🌐 Cross-Language Reuse Strategies

- Shared Contract > Shared Code  
- OpenAPI  
<!-- OpenAPI enables HTTP service definition in a language-agnostic format.
It supports codegen, mocking, validation, and tooling across many ecosystems. -->

# 🌐 Cross-Language Reuse Strategies

- Shared Contract > Shared Code  
- OpenAPI  
- AsyncAPI  
<!-- AsyncAPI brings contract discipline to event-driven systems.
Useful for message brokers like Kafka, NATS, and RabbitMQ. -->

# 🌐 Cross-Language Reuse Strategies

- Shared Contract > Shared Code  
- OpenAPI  
- AsyncAPI  
- Protobuf/GRPC  
<!-- Protobuf allows high-performance binary contracts.
GRPC adds cross-language stubs with strong typing and streaming support. -->

# 🌐 Cross-Language Reuse Strategies

- Shared Contract > Shared Code  
- OpenAPI  
- AsyncAPI  
- Protobuf/GRPC  
- JSON Schema  
<!-- JSON Schema is great for payload validation, document-based services, and testing.
It’s supported widely and complements OpenAPI/AsyncAPI. -->

> “A good contract defines what something must do, not how it does it.”

<!-- Close with the principle: shared contracts enable collaboration between systems,
but interface discipline ensures collaboration between people.
Match intent, not syntax. -->
