# ⚙️ Code Generation: Productivity Without Entropy

<!-- 
This section explains how code generation reinforces sustainability without sacrificing clarity.
It emphasizes a mindset of separating intention from infrastructure: write what you reason about, generate what you don’t.
The goal is to share structure, not logic—and reduce entropy at scale.

# ⚙️ Code Generation: Productivity Without Entropy

- When to generate: Boilerplate serialization, DTOs, mocks  
<!-- Introduce code generation as a tool for structural consistency and reducing repetition.
It handles the parts of code we don’t want humans debugging—plumbing, not purpose. -->

# ⚙️ Code Generation: Productivity Without Entropy

- When to generate: Boilerplate serialization, DTOs, mocks  
- Principle: Generate what you don’t reason about  
<!-- Draw a line between thinking and tooling.
If you aren’t making domain decisions in the code, you probably shouldn’t be writing it by hand. -->

- When to generate: Boilerplate serialization, DTOs, mocks  
- Principle: Generate what you don’t reason about  
- Share what is sharable, generate the plumbing and bindings  
<!-- This is the architectural boundary.
Share contracts and types across systems; generate adapters, validators, and serializers.
Preserve clarity for the developer while enforcing consistency under the hood. -->

<!-- Reinforce that generation is not about laziness—it’s about protecting clarity.
Craftsmanship is about choosing where to invest effort and where to automate wisely. -->
