# 📜 Contracts as the Real API

<!-- 
This section reframes the notion of interfaces in modern architecture.
In distributed and polyglot systems, the true interface is the contract—what systems agree to exchange and honor.
Encourage the audience to treat contracts as architectural commitments, not just technical schemas.

# 📜 Contracts as the Real API

- Interfaces fade, contracts persist  
<!-- Code interfaces are implementation details. Contracts—APIs, schemas, event structures—are what actually connect systems across time, teams, and languages. -->

# 📜 Contracts as the Real API

- Interfaces fade, contracts persist  
- Every API/schema/event is a promise  
<!-- Contracts define not just structure, but intention.
Once you publish it, others build against it. Changing it breaks that promise. -->

# 📜 Contracts as the Real API

- Interfaces fade, contracts persist  
- Every API/schema/event is a promise  
- Poor contracts break systems more than poor code  
<!-- A bad method can be refactored. A bad contract becomes someone else's dependency.
Most long-term software pain comes from unclear or brittle interfaces between systems. -->

> “The real interface of your system isn’t in your code—it’s what you force others to depend on.” – Inspired by Gregor Hohpe

<!-- End with a shift in responsibility: designing good contracts is an act of empathy and long-term thinking.
This sets the foundation for the next section on how to design contracts well. -->
