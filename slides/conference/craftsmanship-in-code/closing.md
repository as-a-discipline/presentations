# 🧭 The Discipline of Durable Design

<!-- 
This section closes the session by tying the mental models and patterns back to a single principle:
craftsmanship is a practice, not a product. Durable systems emerge from consistent design habits—not one-time heroics.
The audience should leave with a renewed commitment to thoughtful architecture and sustainable coding practices.

# 🧭 The Discipline of Durable Design

- Use ACLs to isolate change  
<!-- Reinforce that Anti-Corruption Layers protect long-term architecture by buffering new systems from legacy behavior and models. -->

# 🧭 The Discipline of Durable Design

- Use ACLs to isolate change  
- Let contracts define your architecture  
<!-- Good contracts are the real surface area of your system.
They create clarity, trust, and decoupling—your code flows from them, not the other way around. -->

# 🧭 The Discipline of Durable Design

- Use ACLs to isolate change  
- Let contracts define your architecture  
- Abstract wisely, code consistently  
<!-- Choose patterns that make your intent legible.
Avoid cleverness in favor of consistency. Make architecture a shared language, not a guessing game. -->

<!-- End with a clear takeaway: what you build matters—but how you build it matters more.
Craftsmanship is the accumulation of small, thoughtful decisions that make change survivable and systems sustainable. -->
