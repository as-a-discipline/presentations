# 🧬 Designing Contracts for Change

<!-- 
This section shows how to build contracts that are designed to evolve.
Craftsmanship means planning for uncertainty—these practices keep systems flexible without breaking trust.
The mindset here is proactive extensibility: build for the next change before it arrives.

# 🧬 Designing Contracts for Change

- Reserve fields, plan for growth  
<!-- Encourage reserving fields and designing with future additions in mind.
This creates breathing room without requiring new versions for small evolutions. -->

- Reserve fields, plan for growth  
- Explicitly model optionality  
<!-- Optional is not the same as nullable or “guessable.”
Make optional fields obvious in docs and schemas—define when and why they’re used. -->

- Explicitly model optionality  
- Include sample payloads in spec  
<!-- Good examples clarify ambiguity.
Sample requests/responses are the fastest way to communicate intent to future consumers. -->

<!-- Contracts don’t fail silently—they ripple.
Automated contract tests (schema validators, consumer-driven tests, etc.) keep promises honest across versions and teams. -->
