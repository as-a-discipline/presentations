# 🧱 Abstraction Patterns That Don’t Rot

<!-- 
This section focuses on tried-and-true abstraction patterns that age well and prevent brittle, tangled codebases.
The goal is to reduce conditional logic, enforce separation of concerns, and promote composability.
The mindset: use abstraction to express intent—not to hide it.

# 🧱 Abstraction Patterns That Don’t Rot

- Facade: simplify without hiding intent  
<!-- A Facade provides a unified interface to a subsystem.
It reduces complexity for the caller but should not obscure key behaviors or responsibilities. -->

# 🧱 Abstraction Patterns That Don’t Rot

- Facade: simplify without hiding intent  
- Adapter: translate shape, preserve semantics  
<!-- Adapter allows incompatible interfaces to work together without rewriting internals.
Use it to bridge boundaries—not override contracts. -->

# 🧱 Abstraction Patterns That Don’t Rot

- Facade: simplify without hiding intent  
- Adapter: translate shape, preserve semantics  
- Strategy: swap logic, preserve contract  
<!-- Strategy pattern keeps the interface fixed while varying behavior.
Great for runtime decisions without adding conditionals or branching logic. -->

# 🧱 Abstraction Patterns That Don’t Rot

- Facade: simplify without hiding intent  
- Adapter: translate shape, preserve semantics  
- Strategy: swap logic, preserve contract  
- Null Object: avoid conditional clutter  
> “Abstractions should clarify possibilities—not conceal consequences.”

<!-- Null Object replaces null checks with default behavior.
It’s especially powerful when behavior, not presence, is the variable.
Together, these patterns promote composability without complexity. -->
