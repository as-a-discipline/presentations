# 🧩 The Core Problem

<!-- 
This section uncovers the root challenges that craftsmanship must respond to.
We're not just debugging code—we're diagnosing systemic design issues that compound over time.
Encourage the audience to recognize these symptoms in their own systems and reflect on their causes.

# 🧩 The Core Problem

- Fragile integrations, code rot, hidden coupling  
<!-- These aren't bugs—they're signs of deeper architectural erosion.
Ask the audience: where do integrations fail most? What assumptions are hard-coded? -->

# 🧩 The Core Problem

- Fragile integrations, code rot, hidden coupling  
- Scaling pain due to design shortcuts  
<!-- Scaling isn’t just infrastructure—it’s code structure.
Shortcuts made to ship fast can calcify into barriers to scale. -->

# 🧩 The Core Problem

- Fragile integrations, code rot, hidden coupling  
- Scaling pain due to design shortcuts  
- These aren’t just code problems—they’re pattern problems  
<!-- Reframe the issue: it's not bad coding, it's missing structure.
When we lack patterns, we reinvent chaos. -->

<!-- Close the section with a moment of shared accountability.
The systems we inherit reflect the patterns we used—or didn’t.
Craftsmanship is the discipline of getting that right before it becomes a mess. -->
