# ðŸ“¦ Model Context Protocol Usage Records

- **Purpose**: Define what tools, actions, and interfaces are safe and appropriate to expose to developers or AI agents within a bounded context.
- **Audience**: Architects, platform teams, API designers, agent developers.
- **Lifetime**: Living document. Updated as tools, roles, or safety classifications evolve.
- **Why It Matters**: Prevents misuse or overexposure of sensitive capabilities. Promotes safe, intentional extensibility and agentic behavior.
- **When to Create**: Whenever exposing tools or APIs to agents, developer sandboxes, or external automation contexts.

## ðŸ§  Example: GitHub Actions â€“ Workflow Context

```yaml
context:
  name: GitHub Actions Workflow Context
  description: Tools made available to a workflow job during execution.
  audience: [Developer, GitHub-Hosted Runner, Custom AI Agent]
  goal: Enable CI/CD automation with safe access to repository and environment data.

tools_exposed:
  - name: actions.download-artifact
    description: Download artifacts generated by previous steps or jobs.
    visibility: public
    safety_level: safe
    preconditions:
      - part of same workflow run
    output: artifact file(s)
    side_effects: none

  - name: actions.create-release
    description: Create a GitHub release for a specific tag.
    visibility: internal
    safety_level: guarded
    preconditions:
      - authenticated with `repo` scope token
      - tag must exist
    output: release URL
    side_effects:
      - triggers release webhooks

  - name: actions.delete-run
    description: Deletes a completed workflow run.
    visibility: internal
    safety_level: sensitive
    preconditions:
      - admin permissions on repo
    usage_notes: irreversible; removes audit trail

constraints:
  - actions cannot modify workflow definition at runtime
  - rate limits apply for all API calls
  - execution context is sandboxed

skill_requirements:
  - ci.engineer
  - release.manager

telemetry:
  - logs action invocations to workflow logs
  - errors and usage tracked for audit
```

## ðŸ“„ MCP-UR Template

```yaml
context:
  name: [Context Name]
  description: [Describe the boundary or scenario where these tools are available.]
  audience: [List intended users or agents]
  goal: [What capability or outcome this context supports.]

tools_exposed:
  - name: [Tool or Action Name]
    description: [What this tool does.]
    visibility: [public | internal | guarded]
    safety_level: [safe | guarded | sensitive]
    preconditions:
      - [Required roles, scopes, or permissions]
    output: [What the tool returns]
    side_effects: [Any persistent changes or downstream triggers]
    usage_notes: [Optional guidance or caveats]

constraints:
  - [Limitations, rate limits, environment assumptions]

skill_requirements:
  - [List of roles or capabilities needed to safely invoke tools]

telemetry:
  - [What gets logged, reported, or audited]
