# Artifacts – Structure & Boundaries

<!-- 
This is where most traditional “architecture diagrams” live—but emphasize that they are only meaningful when used to communicate responsibility and interaction, not just structure.
These artifacts are foundational to system comprehension and scalable collaboration.

# Artifacts – Structure & Boundaries

- Context Map / Landscape Diagram  
<!-- Visualizes ownership, boundaries, and relationships between domains or subsystems. Helps with responsibility mapping. -->

# Artifacts – Structure & Boundaries

- Context Map / Landscape Diagram  
- System Model (Interaction + Context)  
<!-- Places the system in its broader environment—showing what it talks to, depends on, or is embedded within. -->

# Artifacts – Structure & Boundaries

- Context Map / Landscape Diagram  
- System Model (Interaction + Context)  
- C4 Model or Layered System Views  
<!-- Provides a consistent way to navigate between zoom levels of architecture—from system to container to component. -->

# Artifacts – Structure & Boundaries

- Context Map / Landscape Diagram  
- System Model (Interaction + Context)  
- C4 Model or Layered System Views  
- API/Interface Contracts  
<!-- Defines clear boundaries for interaction, integration, and reuse. Anchors alignment between teams and across systems. -->

# Artifacts – Structure & Boundaries

- Context Map / Landscape Diagram  
- System Model (Interaction + Context)  
- C4 Model or Layered System Views  
- API/Interface Contracts  
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)  
<!-- Models the flow of data through the system and across trust boundaries. Supports privacy, security, and operational awareness. -->

This is where most traditional “architecture diagrams” live—but emphasize that they are only meaningful when used to communicate responsibility and interaction, not just structure.
Encourage participants to use these artifacts to promote clarity and shared understanding, not just to satisfy documentation requirements.
