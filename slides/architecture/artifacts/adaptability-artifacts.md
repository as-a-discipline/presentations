# Artifacts – Adaptability & Strategic Evolution

<!-- 
This group helps ensure your architecture remains relevant. 
Discuss how these artifacts support planning, resilience, and managing complexity over time.
Encourage participants to think of adaptability as a measurable, artifact-driven capability—not just intuition or agility.
