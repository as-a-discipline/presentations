# Operationalization, Observability & Risk Readiness
#### ðŸ“š Architecture for Operations
#### ðŸŽ¯ Tier 4: Lifecycle Stewardship

<!-- 
Architects must think beyond build timeâ€”what happens during incidents, failures, and high-pressure moments?
These artifacts support resilience, observability, and learning in production environments.
They ensure architecture doesn't just workâ€”it holds up.
