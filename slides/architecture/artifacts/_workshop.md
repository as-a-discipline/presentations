# Architectural Artifacts: 
### Diving in

<!-- 
Begin by framing architecture not as a one-time design phase, but as an ongoing discipline. Explain that architectural artifacts are tangible expressions of architectural thinking. They provide structure, clarity, and continuity throughout the software lifecycle.

Highlight that artifacts aren't just documentationâ€”they are decision-support tools, alignment mechanisms, and learning accelerators. They create visibility across ambiguity, preserve context, and help distributed teams move with confidence.
