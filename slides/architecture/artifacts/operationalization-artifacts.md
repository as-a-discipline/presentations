# Artifacts – Runtime & Operations

<!-- 
Highlight how these artifacts help operational teams trust architecture—and how they allow learning from failures.
These artifacts bridge the gap between design and runtime, making systems observable, recoverable, and governable.
They also support audits, SLAs, and on-call readiness.

Highlight how these artifacts help operational teams trust architecture—and how they allow learning from failures.
Also note how they support audits, SLAs, and on-call readiness. These artifacts close the loop between architecture and reliability.
