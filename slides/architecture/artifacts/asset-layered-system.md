# ðŸ§± Layered System Views

- **Purpose**: Provide multiple, scalable levels of abstraction to describe software systems clearly and completely.
- **Audience**: Architects, engineers, product managers, stakeholders, and cross-functional teams.
- **Lifetime**: Living artifact. Updated as the system evolves or as boundaries, ownership, and technology shift.
- **Why It Matters**: Supports shared understanding, system alignment, onboarding, governance, and documentation. Enables teams to zoom in and out with confidence.
- **When to Create**: At the start of architecture work, during major refactors, platform evolution, or product design initiatives.

## ðŸ§° Common Modeling Frameworks for Architecture

- **C4 Model** â€“ Context, Container, Component, Code (Simon Brown)
- **UML** â€“ Unified Modeling Language (class, sequence, state, etc.)
- **Arc42** â€“ Template for documenting software architecture
- **4+1 Views** â€“ Logical, Development, Process, Physical + Scenarios
- **SAAM/ATAM** â€“ Architecture evaluation methods
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** â€“ Bounded contexts, aggregates, entities
- **BPMN** â€“ Business Process Model and Notation
- **SysML** â€“ Systems Modeling Language (often used for embedded and physical systems)
- **Wardley Maps** â€“ Value chain evolution and strategic mapping

> Choose the model based on **audience**, **evolution stage**, and **decision scope**.
