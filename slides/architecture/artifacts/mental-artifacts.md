# Artifacts – Modeling Mental Context

<!-- 
Each of these helps the architect shift between modes of thinking—analytic, empathetic, ethical, and scenario-based.
Call out MCP as a meta-tool for applying models with precision and communicating modeling intent.
These artifacts are especially useful when dealing with uncertainty, cross-functional communication, or ethical ambiguity.
They turn cognitive gaps and blind spots into navigable structures.

<!-- 
Each of these helps the architect shift between modes of thinking—analytic, empathetic, ethical, and scenario-based.
Together, they provide a toolkit for making architectural thinking more transparent, testable, and inclusive.
They’re especially critical in early-stage design, large stakeholder environments, or when working on systems that evolve over time.
