Tier 2 shiftings the focus from systems to people. 

Architecture isn’t just structure—it’s how we scale clarity, trust, and alignment across growing teams and organizations.

<!--
Well-defined architecture empowers teams. It creates alignment without the need for constant oversight. By establishing clear patterns, boundaries, and conventions, architecture reduces decision fatigue and prevents duplication of effort. Teams move faster not because they are micromanaged, but because they operate within a shared mental model. Architecture becomes the scaffold that enables autonomy at scale.
