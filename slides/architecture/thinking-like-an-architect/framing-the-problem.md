# 🖼️ Framing the Problem, Not Just the Solution

Great architects don’t start with answers—they start with **better questions**:

<!-- 
This slide shifts from solution design to problem definition—where architecture really begins.  

Ask the group: When was the last time the “problem” wasn’t actually the problem?

Framing is where design earns its direction.

# 🖼️ Framing the Problem, Not Just the Solution

Great architects don’t start with answers—they start with **better questions**:

- Framing defines the problem space
<!-- 
Framing sets boundaries, reveals assumptions, and sharpens objectives.  
It’s the act of turning ambiguity into useful structure.  
Design without framing often solves the wrong thing well.

# 🖼️ Framing the Problem, Not Just the Solution

Great architects don’t start with answers—they start with **better questions**:

- Framing defines the problem space
- Framing influences visibility and viability
<!-- 
It affects what trade-offs are seen, what solutions feel acceptable, and how success is judged.  
Misframed problems create elegant failures.  
Ask: Are we solving for the right thing?

# 🖼️ Framing the Problem, Not Just the Solution

Great architects don’t start with answers—they start with **better questions**:

- Framing defines the problem space
- Framing influences visibility and viability
- Reframing reveals premature assumptions
<!-- 
The first version of a problem is often too narrow or anchored in solution bias.  
Reframing broadens perspective and reframes the goal itself.  
Example: Scaling traffic vs. designing for constraints and outcomes.

>  - Design Space Expansion  
<!-- 
Each tool reveals something hidden: unspoken beliefs, fake requirements, unclear success metrics, or missed options.  
Use them before picking a pattern.

# 🖼️ Framing the Problem, Not Just the Solution

Great architects don’t start with answers—they start with **better questions**:

- Framing defines the problem space
- Framing influences visibility and viability
- Reframing reveals premature assumptions
- Architects frame conversations, not just systems
<!-- 
Your job is to help teams ask better questions.  
Framing isn’t soft—it’s structural.  
It’s how you create shared understanding before shared solutions.

Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- Have you ever designed something well—but solved the wrong thing?  
- What framing tools could help your current project?

Remind: Framing is what separates architects from implementors. It’s where value, context, and constraints come together.
