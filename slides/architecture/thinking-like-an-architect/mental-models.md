# ðŸ’­ Mental Models for Architecture

Architects rely on **internal models to navigate complexity and guide decisions**:

<!-- 
This slide introduces mental models as the thinking tools that shape architectural clarity and action.  

Ask the group: Whatâ€™s a model you use all the timeâ€”but havenâ€™t questioned in a while?

Architecture lives in your head before it ever hits the page.

# ðŸ’­ Mental Models for Architecture

Architects rely on **internal models to navigate complexity and guide decisions**:

- Mental models shape perception and decision-making
<!-- 
Theyâ€™re internal frameworks that help us evaluate systems, frame trade-offs, and communicate ideas.  
We use them constantlyâ€”often without realizing it.  
Architecture begins in how we *see* a system.

# ðŸ’­ Mental Models for Architecture

Architects rely on **internal models to navigate complexity and guide decisions**:

- Mental models shape perception and decision-making
- Models are simplificationsâ€”not truths
<!-- 
All models reduce reality. They clarifyâ€”but they also omit.  
Used well, they guide. Used rigidly, they blind.  
Architectural maturity means holding models loosely.

# ðŸ’­ Mental Models for Architecture

Architects rely on **internal models to navigate complexity and guide decisions**:

- Mental models shape perception and decision-making
- Models are simplificationsâ€”not truths
- Use models for both rigor and storytelling
<!-- 
Great architects explain modularity with Legos, and interface contracts with real-world metaphors.  
Metaphors align teams. Technical models guide structure. Use both.  
Storytelling is how models spread.

# ðŸ’­ Mental Models for Architecture

Architects rely on **internal models to navigate complexity and guide decisions**:

- Mental models shape perception and decision-making
- Models are simplificationsâ€”not truths
- Use models for both rigor and storytelling
- Make them explicit, shared, and revisable
<!-- 
Test your models in the open. Invite challenge.  
Reflect on their fit. Adapt or replace them as systems evolve.  
Your toolkit grows with useâ€”and with humility.

> A model is useful not because it is trueâ€”but because it makes better thinking possible.

Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- What mental model do you reach for first?  
- Have you ever applied one too rigidlyâ€”and had to revise?

End by reinforcing: Architecture is as much about *thinking models* as it is about code or diagrams.  
Your mental models define your leverage.

Preview: In the next slide, weâ€™ll look at how architects frame problemsâ€”not just model solutions.
