# ⚖️ Heuristics and Trade-offs

Architecture is the **art of choosing under constraint**:

<!-- 
This slide centers architecture as the discipline of decision-making—not perfection.  

Ask the group: What’s a recent trade-off you’ve made, and what heuristic guided you?

Architects don’t avoid trade-offs—they clarify them.

<!--

-----
heuristic

: involving or serving as an aid to learning, discovery, or problem-solving by experimental and especially trial-and-error methods
: of or relating to exploratory problem-solving techniques that utilize self-educating techniques (such as the evaluation of feedback) to improve performance

# ⚖️ Heuristics and Trade-offs

Architecture is the **art of choosing under constraint**:

- Heuristics guide judgment under uncertainty
<!-- 
Heuristics are not laws—they’re context-aware rules of thumb.  
They provide shared language and a head start in complexity.  
Good architects make their thinking visible with heuristics.

> **Examples of useful heuristics:**
>  - Prefer Composition Over Inheritance
>  - Zero, One, or Infinity
>  - Design for Failure
>  - Optimize for Change
>  - If It’s Hard to Test, It’s Hard to Change

Each of these condenses experience into a reusable lens.  
They spark better conversations—and help teams align faster.  
Heuristics are a tool for coaching, not just choosing.

# ⚖️ Heuristics and Trade-offs

Architecture is the **art of choosing under constraint**:

- Heuristics guide judgment under uncertainty
- Trade-offs are everywhere
<!-- 
Speed vs. scalability. Simplicity vs. flexibility. Maintainability vs. performance.  
Architecture lives in these tensions.  
Don’t hide them—frame them.

# ⚖️ Heuristics and Trade-offs

Architecture is the **art of choosing under constraint**:

- Heuristics guide judgment under uncertainty
- Trade-offs are everywhere
- Make trade-offs explicit and shared
<!-- 
Write down trade-offs. Surface them early.  
Use them to foster buy-in and reveal what’s being valued—and what’s being deferred.  
Transparency builds trust.

# ⚖️ Heuristics and Trade-offs

Architecture is the **art of choosing under constraint**:

- Heuristics guide judgment under uncertainty
- Trade-offs are everywhere
- Make trade-offs explicit and shared
- Revisit trade-offs over time
<!-- 
What made sense during MVP may break at scale.  
Trade-offs aren’t forever—they evolve with the system’s context.  
Re-evaluation is part of the discipline.

> Architecture isn’t about being right—it’s about being intentional, explainable, and adaptable.

<!-- 
Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- Which heuristics show up in your team culture today?  
- Where might you need to introduce new ones?

Remind: Heuristics create leverage. Trade-offs create trust—when made visible.

Preview: Up next, we’ll connect these ideas back to the broader mindset of architecture as a practice of clarity, context, and stewardship.
