# ðŸŒ± Stewardship Over Time

Architects are **stewards of sustainability**, not just creators of structure:

<!-- 
This slide introduces architecture as a long-term responsibilityâ€”not a one-time design task.  

Ask the group: Whoâ€™s accountable for your system *a year* after launch? Is anyone?

Emphasize: Architecture isnâ€™t just an artifactâ€”itâ€™s a relationship over time.

# ðŸŒ± Stewardship Over Time

Architects are **stewards of sustainability**, not just creators of structure:

- Systems thinking beyond today
<!-- 
Architects must zoom out and ask: How will this evolve? What are we locking in? Who carries this forward?  
Systems thinking means seeing dependencies, ecosystems, and second-order effects before they surprise you.  
Ask: What are the invisible assumptions your system is making?

# ðŸŒ± Stewardship Over Time

Architects are **stewards of sustainability**, not just creators of structure:

- Systems thinking beyond today
- Guiding graceful change
<!-- 
Stewardship means guiding systems through change: tech shifts, org reshuffles, scaling demands.  
Itâ€™s not about resisting changeâ€”itâ€™s about absorbing it without collapse.  
Sometimes the role is protector; sometimes, itâ€™s adapter.

# ðŸŒ± Stewardship Over Time

Architects are **stewards of sustainability**, not just creators of structure:

- Systems thinking beyond today
- Guiding graceful change
- Technical debt: strategic vs. corrosive
<!-- 
Not all debt is badâ€”but unacknowledged debt erodes trust and velocity.  
Architects help identify, prioritize, and explain why paying down debt matters.  
Debt should be deliberate, visible, and manageable.

# ðŸŒ± Stewardship Over Time

Architects are **stewards of sustainability**, not just creators of structure:

- Systems thinking beyond today
- Guiding graceful change
- Technical debt: strategic vs. corrosive
- Watching for architectural drift
<!-- 
Over time, systems drift from their intended shape.  
Architects must assess: Does the current reality reflect our principles, patterns, and purpose?  
Drift becomes danger when it leads to fragility or misalignment.

# ðŸŒ± Stewardship Over Time

Architects are **stewards of sustainability**, not just creators of structure:

- Systems thinking beyond today
- Guiding graceful change
- Technical debt: strategic vs. corrosive
- Watching for architectural drift
- Architecture as a living commitment
<!-- 
Stewardship is a form of careâ€”ownership that lasts beyond initial design.  
Great architects tend the lifecycle: from build, to scale, to sunset.  
They are memory-keepers and caretakers of coherence.

Wrap-up Notes:

Close with the reminder: The true test of architecture isnâ€™t just the launchâ€”itâ€™s the aftermath.  

Ask the group:  
- How often do you revisit your architecture after shipping?  
- Where have you seen drift, debt, or degradation set in?

Preview: In the next section, weâ€™ll explore how facilitation connects architectural stewardship with team alignmentâ€”because no steward acts alone.
