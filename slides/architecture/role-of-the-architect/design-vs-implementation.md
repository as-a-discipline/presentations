# 🔧 Architecture vs. Design vs. Implementation

Treating architecture, design, and implementation as **distinct yet connected** improves reasoning and resilience:

- Architecture: Enduring system-level intent
<!-- 
Architecture defines what must be true across the system—for it to evolve, scale, and remain coherent.  
It defines boundaries, abstractions, and systemic trade-offs.  
Think scaffolding, not blueprint.
-->

# 🔧 Architecture vs. Design vs. Implementation

Treating architecture, design, and implementation as **distinct yet connected** improves reasoning and resilience:

- Architecture: Enduring system-level intent
- Design: Context-aware structuring
<!-- 
Design translates architectural constraints into local, module- or feature-level arrangements.  
It reflects near-term needs but aligns with long-term goals.  
Design is the bridge between system vision and solution detail.

# 🔧 Architecture vs. Design vs. Implementation

Treating architecture, design, and implementation as **distinct yet connected** improves reasoning and resilience:

- Architecture: Enduring system-level intent
- Design: Context-aware structuring
- Implementation: Execution and feedback
<!-- 
Implementation is where intent becomes real—code, infra, config, pipelines.  
It fulfills design, honors architecture, and often reveals unknowns that ripple upward.  
Every implementation teaches.

# 🔧 Architecture vs. Design vs. Implementation

Treating architecture, design, and implementation as **distinct yet connected** improves reasoning and resilience:

- Architecture: Enduring system-level intent
- Design: Context-aware structuring
- Implementation: Execution and feedback
- A continuous feedback cycle
<!-- 
While often visualized as top-down, these layers are recursive.  
Implementation reveals flaws in design. Design reveals gaps in architecture.  
The loop isn’t a failure—it’s a feature of adaptive practice.

# 🔧 Architecture vs. Design vs. Implementation

Treating architecture, design, and implementation as **distinct yet connected** improves reasoning and resilience:

- Architecture: Enduring system-level intent
- Design: Context-aware structuring
- Implementation: Execution and feedback
- A continuous feedback cycle
- Intent and consequence define the layer
<!-- 
It’s not about titles. What makes a decision “architectural” is its scope and longevity.  
Choosing a library? Probably design. Shifting from sync to async? Likely architecture.  
Understanding consequence clarifies categorization.

> Architecture is not what you draw—it’s what endures when the code changes.

<!-- 
Wrap-up Notes:

Close with the idea that these distinctions aren’t about slowing down—they enable speed with structure.  
Each layer has a different cognitive role: architecture aligns, design adapts, implementation delivers.

Ask the group:  
- Do you make these distinctions explicitly in your team?  
- When was the last time an implementation decision changed your architecture?

Preview: Next we’ll return to the role of the architect—not just as a decider, but as someone who shepherds intent across all three layers.
