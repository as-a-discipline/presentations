# 🧨 Common Role Anti-Patterns

Even well-meaning architects fall into **patterns that erode trust and impact**:

<!-- 
This slide helps the audience identify failure modes in architectural practice.  

Ask: Which of these have you seen—or accidentally contributed to?

Awareness of anti-patterns is how we protect credibility and effectiveness.

# 🧨 Common Role Anti-Patterns

Even well-meaning architects fall into **patterns that erode trust and impact**:

- Ivory Tower Architecture
<!-- 
When architects work in isolation from teams, designs become detached from reality.  
Diagrams look great—but don’t survive contact with code.  
Architecture must be lived, not handed down.
-->

# 🧨 Common Role Anti-Patterns

Even well-meaning architects fall into **patterns that erode trust and impact**:

- Ivory Tower Architecture
- Architecture Without Accountability
<!-- 
Design is not a phase—it’s a responsibility.  
If the architect vanishes after approval, they sever the feedback loop that validates or challenges their decisions.  
You can’t learn from outcomes you don’t witness.
-->

# 🧨 Common Role Anti-Patterns

Even well-meaning architects fall into **patterns that erode trust and impact**:

- Ivory Tower Architecture
- Architecture Without Accountability
- Design by Committee Without Leadership
<!-- 
Too much consensus can dilute coherence.  
Someone must lead with intent and judgment—even when it’s hard.  
Good leaders gather input but are willing to decide.

# 🧨 Common Role Anti-Patterns

Even well-meaning architects fall into **patterns that erode trust and impact**:

- Ivory Tower Architecture
- Architecture Without Accountability
- Design by Committee Without Leadership
- Buzzwords Over Context
<!-- 
Architects who lead with jargon risk shallow solutions.  
Microservices, DDD, Zero Trust—none of these are silver bullets.  
Architecture must begin with *context*, not trend.

# 🧨 Common Role Anti-Patterns

Even well-meaning architects fall into **patterns that erode trust and impact**:

- Ivory Tower Architecture
- Architecture Without Accountability
- Design by Committee Without Leadership
- Buzzwords Over Context
- Perfectionism Over Progress
<!-- 
The pursuit of perfect can paralyze progress.  
Good architects act with incomplete information—and refine along the way.  
Ask: Are you optimizing or stalling?

Even well-meaning architects fall into **patterns that erode trust and impact**:

- Ivory Tower Architecture
- Architecture Without Accountability
- Design by Committee Without Leadership
- Buzzwords Over Context
- Perfectionism Over Progress
- Neglecting Communication
<!-- 
Silent architects break alignment.  
If you don’t write, explain, or clarify—your designs won’t live.  
Ambiguity is expensive; clarity is your job.

- Buzzwords Over Context
- Perfectionism Over Progress
- Neglecting Communication
- The Non-Implementor
<!-- 
If you can’t build what you design, your guidance may lack credibility.  
Hands-on experience grounds architecture in constraints and trade-offs.  
You don’t need to code every day—but you must *understand* implementation.
-->

### 🤔 When it is okay to not be an implementer❓
<!-- 
Some architects contribute through domain expertise or systems synthesis (e.g., embedded, regulated systems).  
Even then, they must stay close to reality through partnership and review.  
Distance is fine—detachment is not.

> Architects don’t fail from lack of knowledge—they fail from disconnection (or lack of discipline).

<!-- 
Wrap-up Notes:

Invite reflection:  
- Which of these patterns have *you* encountered—or slipped into?  
- Which one do you think is most common in your org?

Use this slide to normalize imperfection while promoting awareness.  
Great architecture isn’t flawless—it’s reflective and adaptive.

Transition: The antidote to these anti-patterns? Engagement, empathy, education, and ownership—all core to the architecture discipline.
