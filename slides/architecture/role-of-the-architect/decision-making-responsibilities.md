# 🧠 Decision-Making Responsibilities

Architects guide decisions that shape **systems, strategy, and sustainability**:

<!-- 
This slide explores one of the core architectural functions: guiding decisions that define systems over time.  

Ask the group: What’s the most impactful architectural decision you’ve seen—or made? What made it hard?

Emphasize: architects aren't decision hoarders—they are decision *designers*.

# 🧠 Decision-Making Responsibilities

Architects guide decisions that shape **systems, strategy, and sustainability**:


- Decisions under uncertainty
<!-- 
Architects regularly operate with incomplete data and unclear priorities.  
Their role is to bring clarity, balance competing needs, and align choices with long-term strategy.  
Ask: How do you navigate ambiguity without getting stuck?

# 🧠 Decision-Making Responsibilities

Architects guide decisions that shape **systems, strategy, and sustainability**:

- Decisions under uncertainty
- Trade-offs across dimensions
<!-- 
Every decision reflects a tension—speed vs. durability, reuse vs. simplicity, control vs. empowerment.  
Architects frame these trade-offs and help teams make conscious, aligned choices.  
The job is not to eliminate tension—it’s to manage it well.

# 🧠 Decision-Making Responsibilities

Architects guide decisions that shape **systems, strategy, and sustainability**:

- Decisions under uncertainty
- Trade-offs across dimensions
- One-way vs. Two-way doors
<!-- 
Architects must distinguish between decisions that are reversible (two-way) and those that are not (one-way).  
This concept, popularized by Amazon, helps prevent over-analysis and encourages fast, safe iteration.  
Ask: Do you treat every decision like it's permanent?

# 🧠 Decision-Making Responsibilities

Architects guide decisions that shape **systems, strategy, and sustainability**:


- Decisions under uncertainty
- Trade-offs across dimensions
- One-way vs. Two-way doors
- Empowering teams to decide
<!-- 
Mature architecture decentralizes decision-making.  
Architects clarify principles and boundaries—then step back to let teams own two-way decisions.  
This grows autonomy *and* new architects.

# 🧠 Decision-Making Responsibilities

Architects guide decisions that shape **systems, strategy, and sustainability**:

- Decisions under uncertainty
- Trade-offs across dimensions
- One-way vs. Two-way doors
- Empowering teams to decide
- Externalizing intent: ADRs, RFCs, principles
<!-- 
Decisions need context. Tools like Architecture Decision Records and Requests for Comments make decisions legible and teachable.  
Good architecture leaves a trail of reasoning others can follow.  
Ask: If you left tomorrow, would your decisions make sense to someone else?

- Decisions under uncertainty
- Trade-offs across dimensions
- One-way vs. Two-way doors
- Empowering teams to decide
- Externalizing intent: ADRs, RFCs, principles
- Decision frameworks > decision ownership
<!-- 
In high-scale orgs, the goal isn't to make every decision—it’s to make decisions *repeatable*.  
Shared principles and evaluation criteria let others ask: “What would the architecture suggest here?”  
When they answer that themselves, culture has taken root.

> Architecture isn’t about making perfect decisions—it’s about making aligned, explainable, and enduring ones.

<!-- 
Wrap-up Notes:

Reinforce that decision-making is a system, not a spotlight moment. The goal is not control—it’s coherence.

You might ask:  
- What trade-offs have you had to manage recently?  
- Do you know which of your decisions are one-way doors?
