# 🧠 Consumer-First API Design

<!-- 
This section centers on designing APIs as user-facing products—not just internal system wrappers.
By starting with the consumer’s intent, we create interfaces that are intuitive, efficient, and future-proof.
Encourage the audience to treat contracts as durable surfaces that serve people, not internal convenience.

# 🧠 Consumer-First API Design

- Beautiful contracts are shaped around external needs  
<!-- 
Architecture that begins with consumer intent results in APIs that are useful, predictable, and human-centered.
This shifts the goal from exposing internal systems to enabling real tasks and solving real problems for users.

- Beautiful contracts are shaped around external needs  
- Design the contract before writing the implementation  
<!-- 
Start with the interface. 
Don’t anchor the contract to your database or transport. 
Define what users need first—then make the system support it, not the other way around.

- Beautiful contracts are shaped around external needs  
- Design the contract before writing the implementation  
- Assume the implementation will change  
<!-- 
The contract must be a point of stability even as the internals evolve. 
This protects consumers from churn and gives your architecture room to adapt behind the scenes.

- Design the contract before writing the implementation  
- Assume the implementation will change  
- Use consumer-driven contract modeling to validate early  
<!-- 
Mock the contract. Collaborate through examples and workflows. 
This reveals gaps and misunderstandings early—before they become expensive. 
It also builds confidence across teams and reduces integration friction.

- Design APIs around user scenarios, not backend structure  
<!-- 
A consumer shouldn’t have to make five calls to do one thing. 
Design contracts around real workflows: what the user sees, does, and expects. 
Scenario-driven decomposition creates focused, useful endpoints.

<!-- 
Consumer-first APIs are not just integration layers—they are product surfaces. 
When we treat them as such, we build trust, reduce waste, and design with lasting impact. 
This is the essence of beautiful contracts: not just how they work—but how they feel to use.
