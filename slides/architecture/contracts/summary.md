# Summary
## Intent, Clarity, and the Language of Systems

<!-- 
This section brings together the themes of intent, structure, and user-centered design.
It reminds architects that clarity at the interface level is a reflection of clarity at the system level.
The contract is not just a technical detail—it is the language of your architecture.

# Summary
## Intent, Clarity, and the Language of Systems

- Architecture zooms in and out: system to interface  
<!-- 
Architects move between the big picture and fine detail. 
Your high-level intent must be legible in the low-level design.
The interface—the contract—is the sharpest, most visible expression of that intent.

## Intent, Clarity, and the Language of Systems

- Architecture zooms in and out: system to interface  
- Beautiful contracts align meaning with structure  
<!-- 
A good contract is not just functional—it’s communicative.
It exposes what the system means, not how it works.
It is shaped by the domain, not the database.

- Architecture zooms in and out: system to interface  
- Beautiful contracts align meaning with structure  
- Good contracts clarify, decouple, and endure  
<!-- 
They survive refactors. They build trust. They reduce coupling and misunderstanding.
A stable contract is a gift to every consumer it touches.

- Beautiful contracts align meaning with structure  
- Good contracts clarify, decouple, and endure  
- Interface design is where architecture meets usability  
<!-- 
This is where the human experience meets the machine boundary.
Great contracts feel intuitive because they were designed with empathy and clarity.
They are the handshake between systems—and between people.

- Good contracts clarify, decouple, and endure  
- Interface design is where architecture meets usability  
- Contracts should be designed, not extracted  
<!-- 
Don't generate them as an afterthought. 
Design them from the outside in. 
Put the consumer at the center. Align with domain language. Build before you build.

> “The best interfaces aren’t clever—they’re clear. They tell the truth of the system in a voice the user understands.”  

<!-- 
Beautiful contracts don’t emerge—they’re made. 
They are where architecture becomes visible, where teams align, and where systems speak for themselves.
Design your contracts with care—because they are your architecture, made legible.
