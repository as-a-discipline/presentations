# 🥋 Architecture Kata and Deliberate Practice

<!-- 
This section introduces the idea that architectural mastery comes from structured, repeated, and reflective practice—not just knowledge.
Kata offer a framework for sharpening judgment, modeling complexity, and building design fluency in a safe, learnable way.
Encourage the audience to treat architecture as a craft that must be practiced to be mastered.

<!-- 
Kata are the system for becoming better architects. 
They turn theory into reflex, decision-making into craft, and individuals into adaptive thinkers.
In a world of growing complexity, practice is not optional—it’s foundational.
