# 🛠️ Designing and Facilitating an Architecture Kata

<!-- 
This section provides practical guidance for running effective kata sessions—whether for individuals or teams.
It emphasizes preparation, timeboxing, constraints, and structured facilitation to simulate real-world design challenges.
Encourage the audience to create safe, focused environments where architectural thinking can be practiced with purpose.

# 🛠️ Designing and Facilitating an Architecture Kata

- Start with a concise, open-ended scenario  
<!-- 
The goal is to prompt deep design thinking—not to test business knowledge. 
Include goals, constraints, and context, but leave ambiguity for participants to explore.
Clarity + openness is the balance.

# 🛠️ Designing and Facilitating an Architecture Kata

- Start with a concise, open-ended scenario  
- Avoid scenarios from your own domain  
<!-- 
Familiarity leads to shortcuts. 
Use well-known domains like e-commerce or media streaming to level the playing field.
This keeps the focus on architecture—not insider knowledge.

# 🛠️ Designing and Facilitating an Architecture Kata

- Start with a concise, open-ended scenario  
- Avoid scenarios from your own domain  
- Introduce real-world architectural constraints  
<!-- 
Performance budgets, compliance requirements, legacy integration—these are what shape real designs.
Constraints drive trade-offs and bring realism to the exercise.

- Start with a concise, open-ended scenario  
- Avoid scenarios from your own domain  
- Introduce real-world architectural constraints  
- Timebox the exercise to build fluency  
<!-- 
Time constraints force prioritization and simplification.
30-minute windows per design phase are enough to push for clarity without burnout.
It’s about fluency, not perfection.

- Avoid scenarios from your own domain  
- Introduce real-world architectural constraints  
- Timebox the exercise to build fluency  
- Provide shared tools and output templates  
<!-- 
Use diagrams, ADRs, and risk logs to guide the process.
Structure supports focus, and common formats make feedback easier and richer.

<!-- 
Guide the room, don’t steer it. 
Ask clarifying questions, encourage quieter voices, and let disagreement breathe.
The facilitator’s job is to support—not to solve.

- Capture outcomes and reflect  
<!-- 
The real learning comes at the end. 
Ask: What decisions were made? What worked? What would we change?
Use this reflection to drive lasting growth—not just a fun session.

<!-- 
A well-run kata gives teams a sandbox for judgment, creativity, and collaboration. 
It builds habits before habits are needed, and prepares minds for clarity when the pressure is on.
That’s the power of architectural rehearsal.
