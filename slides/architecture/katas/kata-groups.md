# ü§ù Collaborative Practice: Doing Kata in Groups

<!-- 
This section emphasizes that architecture is inherently collaborative.
Practicing kata as a team builds both technical skill and communication fluency‚Äîessential traits for real-world architectural work.
Encourage the audience to structure group sessions intentionally, not just casually.

- Architecture is a team sport  
<!-- 
Most architectural decisions involve negotiation, alignment, and consensus. 
Practicing kata in groups mirrors real-world dynamics and strengthens shared decision-making muscles.

# ü§ù Collaborative Practice: Doing Kata in Groups

- Architecture is a team sport  
- Group kata build shared mental models and expose communication gaps  
<!-- 
Team-based kata force participants to articulate their reasoning, test assumptions, and align on intent.
They reveal misalignments early‚Äîbefore they appear in production systems.

# ü§ù Collaborative Practice: Doing Kata in Groups

- Architecture is a team sport  
- Group kata build shared mental models and expose communication gaps  
- Use silent design rounds to surface individual insights  
<!-- 
Start solo. Then compare. 
This avoids groupthink and surfaces ideas that might never emerge in open discussion. 
Silence reveals diversity before convergence.

# ü§ù Collaborative Practice: Doing Kata in Groups

- Architecture is a team sport  
- Group kata build shared mental models and expose communication gaps  
- Use silent design rounds to surface individual insights  
- Assign rotating roles to balance the room  
<!-- 
Roles like facilitator, devil‚Äôs advocate, or customer proxy ensure different angles are represented.
They also help quieter voices participate and encourage role empathy.

- Assign rotating roles to balance the room  
- Visual collaboration accelerates shared understanding  
<!-- 
Whiteboards, diagrams, and sticky notes align teams faster than discussion alone.
Visual thinking is architectural thinking. 
Group sketching is a catalyst for clarity.

<!-- 
Close each session with reflection. 
What worked? What didn‚Äôt? What would you do differently? 
This turns participation into progress.

<!-- 
Solo practice builds clarity. Group practice builds cohesion.
Together, they form the foundation of strong architectural culture.
The best teams don‚Äôt just ship‚Äîthey think together, too.
