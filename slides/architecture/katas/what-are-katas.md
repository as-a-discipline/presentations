# 🧩 What are Architecture Kata?

<!-- 
This section defines architecture kata as structured, repeatable exercises for building architectural skill. 
They simulate the ambiguity and constraint of real-world design, enabling deeper reflection and stronger judgment.
Encourage the audience to view kata as a low-risk, high-return way to grow individually and collectively.

# 🧩 What are Architecture Kata?

- Kata are repeatable, safe practice for architectural thinking  
<!-- 
Architecture kata simulate system design challenges without production pressure. 
They allow you to rehearse decision-making, identify trade-offs, and communicate ideas—before real stakes are involved.

# 🧩 What are Architecture Kata?

- Kata are repeatable, safe practice for architectural thinking  
- Each kata begins with an intentionally underspecified scenario  
<!-- 
Kata mirror real-world ambiguity. 
You’re given business goals, constraints, and context—but not a complete spec. 
The goal is to shape clarity through architectural reasoning, not to find a “right answer.”

# 🧩 What are Architecture Kata?

- Kata are repeatable, safe practice for architectural thinking  
- Each kata begins with an intentionally underspecified scenario  
- Constraints drive creativity and realism  
<!-- 
Kata use limited time, tools, or scope to model real-world trade-offs. 
This forces you to prioritize, communicate, and design within boundaries—just like in production systems.

<!-- 
Designing global CDNs, multi-tenant SaaS, or legacy modernization efforts—these aren’t toy problems. 
They represent patterns every architect should wrestle with in a safe, thoughtful way.
