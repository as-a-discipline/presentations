# 🧑‍🏫 Growing Architects

Architecture becomes a discipline when it becomes **shared, taught, and practiced**:

<!-- 
This slide shifts from individual influence to legacy: how architects grow *more* architects.  

Ask the group: Who helped you grow into an architectural thinker? Who are *you* growing?

Architecture is not a solo act—it’s a generational craft.

# 🧑‍🏫 Growing Architects

Architecture becomes a discipline when it becomes **shared, taught, and practiced**:

- Decentralize two-way door decisions
<!-- 
Mature architects know when to step back.  
They create space for teams to own low-risk, reversible decisions—especially those closest to the work.  
This builds autonomy, accountability, and confidence.

# 🧑‍🏫 Growing Architects

Architecture becomes a discipline when it becomes **shared, taught, and practiced**:

- Decentralize two-way door decisions
- Apprenticeship over abstraction
<!-- 
Architecture is best taught through guided practice—not just documents and principles.  
Like craftspeople, architects must model their thinking, share context, and coach others through design.  
“Always be building architects” means mentorship is the job—not a bonus.

# 🧑‍🏫 Growing Architects

Architecture becomes a discipline when it becomes **shared, taught, and practiced**:

- Decentralize two-way door decisions
- Apprenticeship over abstraction
- Frame problems, don’t dictate answers
<!-- 
Architects help others see trade-offs, risks, and consequences—but don’t take over the decision.  
The goal is clarity of thought, not control.  
Every framing moment is a teaching moment.

# 🧑‍🏫 Growing Architects

Architecture becomes a discipline when it becomes **shared, taught, and practiced**:

- Decentralize two-way door decisions
- Apprenticeship over abstraction
- Frame problems, don’t dictate answers
- Use artifacts to teach
<!-- 
Decision records, design briefs, and pattern libraries aren’t just documentation—they are educational tools.  
Well-written rationale teaches future readers *how* to think architecturally.  
If your design doc can’t teach, it’s not done.

# 🧑‍🏫 Growing Architects

Architecture becomes a discipline when it becomes **shared, taught, and practiced**:

- Decentralize two-way door decisions
- Apprenticeship over abstraction
- Frame problems, don’t dictate answers
- Use artifacts to teach
- Capability is the only scalable architecture
<!-- 
The best architectural investment is people.  
When more people think in systems, weigh trade-offs, and understand long-term effects, quality increases *everywhere*.  
This is how you grow stewardship, not just structure.

Wrap-up Notes:

End by reinforcing: This is a discipline. And like every true discipline—medicine, law, craftsmanship—it must be taught, practiced, and passed on.

Ask the group:  
- Who are you apprenticing right now?  
- Do your rituals (reviews, decisions, documents) teach or just inform?

This connects directly to the final sections on architecture as a living discipline—more than diagrams, it’s a generational craft.
