Introduce this idea by asking: 
- “How do you balance speed with safety in your org?” 

Explain that governance doesn’t mean slowing people down—it means creating structure that helps teams make good decisions without constant oversight. 

Cite examples like API contracts that prevent breaking changes or infrastructure templates that enforce security by default.

> Architecture is like **a guardrail system**—invisible when you're on track, protective when you're veering off.

<!--
In large systems, architecture is governance by design. 

It sets the rules for what is allowed, what is enforced, and what must be reviewed. 

Whether expressed through API contracts, reusable patterns, or platform policies, architectural decisions define the boundaries of autonomy and compliance. 

Good architecture balances innovation with control, enabling teams to move quickly without compromising integrity or oversight.
