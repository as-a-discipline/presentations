# 🏛 Tier 1: Navigating Trade-Offs

Architecture helps teams and the business reason about **what matters most**—and what they’re willing to trade for it.

Key trade-offs architects must navigate:

<!-- 
Architecture is about *thinking in tensions*. 

Every system is a negotiation between competing forces. Good architecture doesn’t eliminate trade-offs—it reveals them, evaluates them, 
and makes the best compromise visible and repeatable.

Ask: Where in your system have you had to make trade-offs that later became pain points? Were they intentional? Did you document them?

Architecture helps teams and the business reason about **what matters most**—and what they’re willing to trade for it.

Key trade-offs architects must navigate:

- Performance vs Portability
<!-- 
Highly optimized code may tie you to specific platforms or hardware, limiting future moves.

Key trade-offs architects must navigate:

- Performance vs Portability
- Simplicity vs Flexibility
<!-- 
Simpler architectures are easier to operate but might restrict the ability to adapt to change.

> “There is no architecture without trade-offs. But great architecture makes the **right compromises**—with eyes wide open and the long view in mind.”

<!--
Every architectural decision implies a set of trade-offs. A decision that optimizes for performance might sacrifice portability. 

Choosing a simpler architecture might reduce flexibility for future changes. 

Architecture gives teams a structured way to make these trade-offs intentionally, aligning with business objectives and technical constraints. 

The role of the architect is not to eliminate trade-offs, but to make them visible, reasoned, and aligned with long-term value.
