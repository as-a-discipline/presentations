<!-- 
This slide reframes architecture as an act of storytelling. 

Architectural communication—whether through diagrams, ADRs, or domain models—creates shared understanding. 

Ask the group:

Emphasize that clarity is not a bonus—it’s a responsibility.

> The true power of architecture is not in what it dictates, but in what it helps everyone understand.

<!--
Architecture is also a language a way to communicate complex ideas, expectations, and constraints across teams and over time. 

Models like C4, sequence diagrams, and architecture decision records (ADRs) provide the vocabulary for shared understanding. 

When properly documented and visualized, architecture aligns developers, testers, operators, and product managers alike. 

It reduces ambiguity and fosters coherent collaboration across organizational boundaries.
