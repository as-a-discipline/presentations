# 🌐 Tier 3: Architecture in System Plumbing

<!-- 
This is where you explain that architecture includes the “invisible infrastructure” — the connective tissue that enables systems to operate. 

Most major outages don’t come from bad business logic—they come from misconfigured queues, missed retries, slow databases, or leaky observability. 

Ask: Do your system diagrams include the plumbing? If not, why not?

------
What Do We Mean by “Plumbing”? 

"Plumbing” to refer to the connective tissue of software systems: the foundational tools and services that enable components to communicate, synchronize, store, and coordinate effectively. 

This includes technologies like message queues, databases, caches, service meshes, service discovery, logging pipelines, and orchestration layers.

Just as plumbing in a building enables the invisible flow of water and waste, system plumbing supports the hidden yet essential flows of data, control, and operations across modern distributed systems.

  Architecture isn’t just about choosing EC2 or Kubernetes. It’s about the connective layers that actually make the system work.

- Goes beyond compute, storage, and networks
- Includes queues, caches, databases, orchestration layers

<!--
These are the “pipes” of your system. They move data, synchronize actions, and carry intent between components.

- Goes beyond compute, storage, and networks
- Includes queues, caches, databases, orchestration layers
- Shapes communication, coordination, and scalability

<!--
The structure of your plumbing dictates how services talk, how fast they recover, and how well they can scale together.

- Goes beyond compute, storage, and networks
- Includes queues, caches, databases, orchestration layers
- Shapes communication, coordination, and scalability
- Defines system boundaries: latency, consistency, resilience

<!--
Every plumbing choice defines what your system can tolerate. How fast it is. How available it is. How reliable it is.

<!--
Get the plumbing wrong and your developers will spend all day debugging retries, deadlocks, and flakiness. Get it right, and they can move fast with confidence.

> **Plumbing is infrastructure with intent.**
> It’s not just wiring. It’s policy, flow control, and fault boundaries. 
> Good plumbing enables systems to evolve without needing to be ripped out.
>
> The best plumbing can be changed with no impact to the system.

<!--
 Modern architecture goes beyond traditional infrastructure like compute, storage, and networks. It must also account for the “plumbing” of the system: message queues, databases, caches, service meshes, and orchestration layers. These elements shape how systems communicate, coordinate, and scale. They define latency, consistency, throughput, and resilience boundaries. Effective architectural decisions in this space impact everything from performance to developer experience. Architecture in system plumbing ensures that foundational services are not only reliable and secure but are also composable, observable, and evolvable supporting long-term adaptability without rework.
