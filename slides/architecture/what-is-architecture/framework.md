# 🧬 Four-Tier Framework

<!-- 
This slide introduces the core framework for thinking like an architect—not just designing systems, but understanding architecture’s place in the organization and its evolution over time. 

Explain that many teams only focus on one or two layers: 
- maybe the technical design (Context) 
- or operational runtime (Lifecycle). 

But to think and lead like an architect, we need to think in multiple dimensions: 
- purpose
- people 
- context
- and time

> “Architecture doesn’t just describe what is built—it shapes how systems grow, survive, and scale across people and time. 
> Its impact endures beyond its creator. Someone will inherit it—so design with stewardship in mind.”

<!-- 
This is the meta-framework we’ll use to organize the rest of this session. 

Each tier will get its own deep dive. 

Encourage participants to reflect on where they currently spend most of their architectural thinking—and where they’re less practiced
