<!-- 
Before we continue, it’s worth acknowledging a growing viewpoint in the industry—one that questions whether we need “architecture” at all.

These perspectives aren’t wrong—they’re often responding to the **bloat and rigidity** of traditional architecture. But taken too far, they ignore something critical:

Let’s look at where these beliefs come from—and where they might fall short.

# 🐣 Evolutionary Architecture

- **Agile minimalists**: Let architecture *emerge*.

> “Working software over comprehensive documentation,” right? The Agile Manifesto emphasizes feedback and iteration, which is powerful—but when taken to an extreme, it can lead to short-term decisions that lock in long-term consequences.

<!-- 
Without early clarity on boundaries, responsibilities, or scalability concerns, teams often "discover" architecture the hard way—when velocity drops and no one knows why the system behaves the way it does.

# 🐣 Evolutionary Architecture

- **Agile minimalists**: Let architecture *emerge*.
- **Functional thinkers**: Domain modeling replaces it.

> In Domain-Driven Design and functional programming communities, there’s a strong belief that if you model the problem correctly, good architecture will follow.

<!-- 
That’s partially true—clarity of domain does help—but it doesn’t address infrastructure, data flow, observability, or external integrations. Architecture lives at the edges too—not just inside the domain model.

# 🐣 Evolutionary Architecture

- **Agile minimalists**: Let architecture *emerge*.
- **Functional thinkers**: Domain modeling replaces it.
- **Serverless advocates**: Platform hides it.

> When infrastructure is abstracted away—via serverless or managed services—it’s tempting to think the hard architectural work disappears.

<!--
But latency, failure modes, cost scaling, and security boundaries still exist. Someone has to reason about how these systems interact—even if it’s not in code. If no one is making those decisions explicitly, the platform is doing it *by default*.

### **_Every_** system has architecture.
> The question is whether it’s **intentional** or **accidental**."

<!--
Close by reframing architecture as a choice, not a burden. You don’t need a heavyweight process—but you do need *intentionality*.
Think of architecture like gravity—it’s there whether or not you design for it.
