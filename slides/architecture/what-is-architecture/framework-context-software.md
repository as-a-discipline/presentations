# 🌐 Tier 3: Architecture in Software Engineering

Software architecture defines:

<!--
Introduce this as the most familiar territory—how we structure software systems at the component and module level.

But emphasize: this is **not just code organization**. Architecture here defines modularity, boundaries, and change resilience.
 
Explain how good software architecture allows the system to evolve without introducing chaos. 
 
Reference examples like layered architecture, hexagonal/clean architecture, and bounded contexts in microservices.

- Major components and boundaries
<!-- 
Who talks to whom, and how often? Define surface areas clearly.

> “Code is the detail. Architecture is the shape of what will be possible tomorrow.”

<!-- 
In software systems, architecture refers to the high-level structure: the major components, their roles, and how they communicate. 
 
But it’s not a static picture. Software architecture evolves through decisions made over time decisions about modularity, dependency management, resilience, scalability, and more.
 
A well-architected system supports change without chaos and adapts as new features and constraints emerge.
