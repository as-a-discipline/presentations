# 🌐 Tier 3: Applied Contexts & Execution

Architecture shows up in:

<!--
Tier 3 is where architecture stops being theory and starts becoming traceable in real systems.

 It’s not just about planning—it’s about how architecture shows up in software, enterprise structures, platform specialization, and the integration plumbing that binds it all. 
 
 Highlight that an architect who can’t work across these contexts becomes a bottleneck or an ivory tower. True architectural influence spans domains.

> Architecture is the **skeletal system** of the enterprise—it connects, supports, and shapes every layer of the organism.

<!--
These dimensions cover where architecture manifests in practice across software, enterprise systems, infrastructure, integration plumbing, and operational environments. 

They help architects think across domains and deliver adaptable, observable, and resilient systems in the real world.
