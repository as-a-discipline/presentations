# 🧘 Training Meta-Cognition

Build self-awareness with **deliberate mental training**:

<!-- 
This slide translates reflective thinking into practical exercises.  

Ask the group: How often do you reflect *during* your work—not just after it?

Meta-cognition is a skill—not a trait. Let’s train it.

# 🧘 Training Meta-Cognition

Build self-awareness with **deliberate mental training**:

- Architecture Journal Routine
<!-- 
Daily or session-end reflection: What decision was made, what assumptions influenced it, and what felt uncertain?  
Revisit weekly to reveal patterns, blind spots, and cognitive evolution.  
Turning experience into insight builds durable awareness.
-->

# 🧘 Training Meta-Cognition

Build self-awareness with **deliberate mental training**:

- Architecture Journal Routine
- Retrospective Replay
<!-- 
Reconstruct past architecture decisions—what was assumed, known, inferred?  
Reframe with present insight.  
This exercise reveals how context, framing, and bias shape outcomes.
-->

# 🧘 Training Meta-Cognition

Build self-awareness with **deliberate mental training**:

- Architecture Journal Routine
- Retrospective Replay
- Assumption Mapping
<!-- 
In the moment, stop and list 5–10 assumptions: technical, behavioral, organizational.  
Group into “safe,” “risky,” and “untested.”  
Ask: What would validate or challenge the untested ones?  
This turns invisible thinking into shared reasoning.

# 🧘 Training Meta-Cognition

Build self-awareness with **deliberate mental training**:

- Architecture Journal Routine
- Retrospective Replay
- Assumption Mapping
- Mindful Thinking Transitions
<!-- 
After meetings or sessions, reflect quietly:  
What role was I in? Did I switch perspectives well?  
Listening mode vs. solving mode?  
Trains flexibility between roles—facilitator, modeler, explainer.

# 🧘 Training Meta-Cognition

Build self-awareness with **deliberate mental training**:

- Architecture Journal Routine
- Retrospective Replay
- Assumption Mapping
- Mindful Thinking Transitions
- Guided Self-Dialogue
<!-- 
Write a brief internal debate between “The Confident Architect” and “The Curious Challenger.”  
Use it to question beliefs or decisions playfully and safely.  
This builds inner resilience and softens overconfidence.

> You don’t grow judgment by reading more—you grow it by reflecting better.

<!-- 
Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- Which of these exercises could you try this week?  
- What’s your current reflection habit—if any?

Remind: Architecture isn’t just practiced through code or design—it’s practiced through how we *think about* our thinking.
