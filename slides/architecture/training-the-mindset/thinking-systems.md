# 🌐 Systems Thinking

<!-- 
This slide deepens the architect’s responsibility to think in networks, interactions, and evolution—not just components.  

Ask the group: Where in your system today is the real behavior coming from interactions—not individual parts?

To architect is to zoom out and look for ripple effects.

# 🌐 Systems Thinking

- Behavior emerges from interactions  
<!-- 
Systems don’t behave like their parts—they behave like their connections.  
What seems like a config change might cause a feature delay, an ops burden, or UX regression.  
Architecture is more about relationships than components.

# 🌐 Systems Thinking

- Behavior emerges from interactions  
- Identify feedback loops and cascading effects  
<!-- 
Some changes reinforce dysfunction; others unlock resilience.  
Systems thinking means spotting reinforcing or balancing loops across technical and human dynamics.  
Ask: What patterns are we unintentionally feeding?

- Behavior emerges from interactions  
- Identify feedback loops and cascading effects  
- Think across disciplines  
<!-- 
Systems thinking borrows from ecology, logistics, economics.  
It means modeling subsystems to business flows, service health to delivery pipelines, and latency to team handoffs.  
It’s where software meets sociology.

# 🌐 Systems Thinking

- Behavior emerges from interactions  
- Identify feedback loops and cascading effects  
- Think across disciplines  
- Ask not just “What does it do?” but “What might it become?”  
<!-- 
Architects think in consequences—not just correctness.  
Model the future state, not just the current fix.  
Great systems are designed for adaptation.

- Think across disciplines  
- Ask not just “What does it do?” but “What might it become?”  
- Time is part of the system  
<!-- 
Systems degrade, evolve, and surprise us.  
Resilient architecture anticipates drift, decay, and new constraints.  
Design for the life of the system—not just the launch.

> Architects don’t just design structures—they guide systems that move, evolve, and sometimes fail.

<!-- 
Ask the group:  
- Where are your systems behaving like systems—not just code?  
- What feedback loops or time-based effects do you need to better understand?

Remind: Systems thinking is how architects lead through structure—not control.
