# 🧩 Training Pattern Recognition

<!-- 
This slide turns pattern recognition into a discipline—trainable through analysis, synthesis, inversion, and observation.  

Ask the group: What’s one way you’ve learned to see a pattern more clearly in the last year?

Pattern recognition isn’t just memory—it’s perception in motion.

# 🧩 Training Pattern Recognition

- Anti-Pattern Hunt  
<!-- 
Study a legacy system or incident-heavy repo.  
Look for recurring friction—tight coupling, cascading failures, bad retries.  
Map to anti-patterns and propose better structures.  
Failure is often a system *telling you something*.

# 🧩 Training Pattern Recognition

- Anti-Pattern Hunt  
- Architecture Pattern Remix  
<!-- 
Take a known pattern—like event sourcing or circuit breaker—and apply it outside your domain.  
How would “event sourcing” work in HR onboarding?  
Stretching the pattern helps separate form from dogma.

# 🧩 Training Pattern Recognition

- Anti-Pattern Hunt  
- Architecture Pattern Remix  
- Pattern Inversion Challenge  
<!-- 
Pick a common design pattern and *reverse* it.  
What if you violated microservices? Or CQRS?  
Would it fail—or could it work better in a specific context?  
This teaches when patterns are valid—and when they’re dangerous.

# 🧩 Training Pattern Recognition

- Anti-Pattern Hunt  
- Architecture Pattern Remix  
- Pattern Inversion Challenge  
- Pattern Safari (Non-Technical)  
<!-- 
Go observe the world—look for queues, store layouts, road systems.  
What are the repeated forms? Why do they work—or not?  
This expands your sensitivity to structure, flow, and affordance.

# 🧩 Training Pattern Recognition

- Anti-Pattern Hunt  
- Architecture Pattern Remix  
- Pattern Inversion Challenge  
- Pattern Safari (Non-Technical)  
- Folklore to Framework (Non-Technical)  
<!-- 
Take a proverb or folk saying (“don’t put all eggs in one basket”) and translate it into a design heuristic.  
What’s the architectural equivalent? Is it sound?  
This builds intuition and cross-domain reasoning.

> Pattern recognition is not just technical—it’s architectural storytelling, 
> built from what you’ve seen, questioned, and remixed.

<!-- 
Ask the group:  
- Which of these exercises feels most immediately useful?  
- Can you run one of these with your team in the next sprint?

Remind: Patterns are not templates—they are *tools for thinking*.  
The more you explore and test them, the more fluently they serve you.

Recommended Book:
Title: A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander
Purpose: Although focused on architecture in the physical world, this book is foundational to understanding how patterns shape design, context, and experience. It deeply influenced software pattern thinking and remains a rich source of design principles across disciplines.
