# 🧩 Training Pattern Recognition

<!-- 
This slide turns pattern recognition into a discipline—trainable through analysis, synthesis, inversion, and observation.  

Ask the group: What’s one way you’ve learned to see a pattern more clearly in the last year?

Pattern recognition isn’t just memory—it’s perception in motion.
-->

To sharpen pattern fluency, **build memory and test flexibility**:

- ❌ Anti-Pattern Hunt
<!-- 
Study a legacy system or incident-heavy repo.  
Look for recurring friction—tight coupling, cascading failures, bad retries.  
Map to anti-patterns and propose better structures.  
Failure is often a system *telling you something*.
-->

- 🎛️ Architecture Pattern Remix
<!-- 
Take a known pattern—like event sourcing or circuit breaker—and apply it outside your domain.  
How would “event sourcing” work in HR onboarding?  
Stretching the pattern helps separate form from dogma.
-->

- 🔁 Pattern Inversion Challenge
<!-- 
Pick a common design pattern and *reverse* it.  
What if you violated microservices? Or CQRS?  
Would it fail—or could it work better in a specific context?  
This teaches when patterns are valid—and when they’re dangerous.
-->

- 🐾 Pattern Safari (Non-Technical)
<!-- 
Go observe the world—look for queues, store layouts, road systems.  
What are the repeated forms? Why do they work—or not?  
This expands your sensitivity to structure, flow, and affordance.
-->

- 📜 Folklore to Framework (Non-Technical)
<!-- 
Take a proverb or folk saying (“don’t put all eggs in one basket”) and translate it into a design heuristic.  
What’s the architectural equivalent? Is it sound?  
This builds intuition and cross-domain reasoning.
-->

> Pattern recognition is not just technical—it’s architectural storytelling, built from what you’ve seen, questioned, and remixed.

Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- Which of these exercises feels most immediately useful?  
- Can you run one of these with your team in the next sprint?

Remind: Patterns are not templates—they are *tools for thinking*.  
The more you explore and test them, the more fluently they serve you.

Preview: Next, we’ll look at abstraction—how to simplify complexity without losing connection to what matters.
