# 🌫️ Ambiguity Tolerance

<!-- 
Ambiguity is not the enemy of architecture—it’s the terrain we operate in.  
Great architects don’t eliminate ambiguity—they navigate through it.

Ask the group: What’s a decision you’re holding off on because of uncertainty?  
What would it look like to move forward *with* that ambiguity?

# 🌫️ Ambiguity Tolerance

- Ambiguity is constant  
<!-- Architects work in systems full of unknowns: partial data, conflicting needs, and moving targets. Waiting for perfect clarity is often just stalling.  
Call out that ambiguity isn’t a temporary phase—it’s the permanent backdrop of architectural work. Clarity is something we *create*, not wait for.

# 🌫️ Ambiguity Tolerance

- Ambiguity is constant  
- Regulate emotion, not just logic  
<!-- Many architects default to binary thinking or decision paralysis. Talk about emotional regulation—holding space for uncertainty without losing your ability to guide.  
Ambiguity triggers emotional discomfort, not just technical gaps.

# 🌫️ Ambiguity Tolerance

- Ambiguity is constant  
- Regulate emotion, not just logic  
- Say “I don’t know”—then lead anyway  
<!-- Acknowledging uncertainty builds trust if paired with forward motion.  
Say: “I don’t know yet, but here’s how we’ll figure it out.”  
This models humility, credibility, and proactive leadership.

# 🌫️ Ambiguity Tolerance

- Ambiguity is constant  
- Regulate emotion, not just logic  
- Say “I don’t know”—then lead anyway  
- Design for evolution, not just conditions  
<!-- Don’t plan for a single outcome—frame decisions with flexibility.  
Use conditional thinking and “minimum viable decisions” to move forward now and adjust later.

> True clarity comes not before the decision, but often **after** it.  
> Your job is to move **despite** the fog—not wait for it to lift.

<!-- 
Close by reminding: Architecture is not the pursuit of certainty.  
It’s the creation of *structure within uncertainty*—for systems, teams, and strategies.  
Ambiguity isn’t solved—it’s designed *through*.
