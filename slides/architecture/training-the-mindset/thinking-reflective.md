# 🪞 Meta-Cognition & Reflective Thinking

Great architects grow by **examining their own thinking**:

<!-- 
This slide introduces self-awareness as a core architectural skill—not an optional trait.  

Ask the group: When was the last time you reflected on *how* you made a decision—not just what you decided?

The best architects don’t just think clearly—they think *about* how they think.

# 🪞 Meta-Cognition & Reflective Thinking

Great architects grow by **examining their own thinking**:

- Meta-cognition fuels continuous improvement
<!-- 
Thinking about thinking helps architects refine their models, test their instincts, and evolve beyond habit.  
It’s how judgment gets sharper over time.  
Architectural growth is self-aware.

# 🪞 Meta-Cognition & Reflective Thinking

Great architects grow by **examining their own thinking**:

- Meta-cognition fuels continuous improvement
- Reflective thinking happens *during*, not just after
<!-- 
It’s not just for post-mortems.  
Ask: What assumptions am I carrying? Why does this feel familiar?  
Reflection is most powerful *in the moment*.

# 🪞 Meta-Cognition & Reflective Thinking

Great architects grow by **examining their own thinking**:

- Meta-cognition fuels continuous improvement
- Reflective thinking happens *during*, not just after
- Avoiding cognitive traps
<!-- 
Self-awareness helps spot overconfidence, groupthink, and premature convergence.  
It adds a buffer between reaction and response—between “seems right” and “is right for now.”  
Architecture is too impactful to run on autopilot.

# 🪞 Meta-Cognition & Reflective Thinking

Great architects grow by **examining their own thinking**:

- Meta-cognition fuels continuous improvement
- Reflective thinking happens *during*, not just after
- Avoiding cognitive traps
- Strategic pause in fast-moving environments
<!-- 
In fast-paced work, reflection feels like a luxury.  
But it’s a force multiplier—clarity today saves confusion tomorrow.  
Slow down to speed up *well*.

> Great architecture begins with great awareness—of systems, of trade-offs, and of self.

Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- Do you have rituals or prompts that help you reflect while working?  
- What would it look like to build self-checks into your architectural process?

This slide reinforces architecture as an internal discipline—not just a role.  
Preview: Next, we’ll explore specific tools for exercising reflective practice through architectural kata and design critique.
