# ðŸ§  Training the Architectâ€™s Mindset

To practice architecture, you must first **train how you think**:

<!-- 
This slide introduces architecture as a form of adaptive intelligenceâ€”not just a technical or design skillset.  

Ask the group: What thinking patterns have helped you most when designing systems?  
What modes of thinking do you feel less confident in?

Architecture isnâ€™t just builtâ€”itâ€™s practiced through how we think.

# ðŸ§  Training the Architectâ€™s Mindset

To practice architecture, you must first **train how you think**:

- Adaptive intelligence across modes
<!-- 
Architects shift between systems thinking, scenario modeling, ethical foresight, and empathyâ€”sometimes within a single conversation.  
This range isnâ€™t optionalâ€”itâ€™s the job.  
Cognitive fluency defines architectural value.

# ðŸ§  Training the Architectâ€™s Mindset

To practice architecture, you must first **train how you think**:

- Adaptive intelligence across modes
- See the big pictureâ€”and the sharp edge
<!-- 
Zooming out to see the ecosystem, zooming in to catch edge casesâ€”architects must hold both views at once.  
Youâ€™re designing structure *and* behaviorâ€”at scale and under load.  
Ambiguity and complexity coexist.

# ðŸ§  Training the Architectâ€™s Mindset

To practice architecture, you must first **train how you think**:

- Adaptive intelligence across modes
- See the big pictureâ€”and the sharp edge
- Architects as high-context knowledge workers
<!-- 
Architects translate across disciplines, roles, and intentions.  
They synthesize domain constraints, organizational politics, technical trade-offs, and human needs.  
They create clarity where none existsâ€”yet.

# ðŸ§  Training the Architectâ€™s Mindset

To practice architecture, you must first **train how you think**:

- Adaptive intelligence across modes
- See the big pictureâ€”and the sharp edge
- Architects as high-context knowledge workers
- Tools: not just diagrams and code, but language, judgment, and influence
<!-- 
What separates a designer from an architect is how they create conditions for better decisions.  
Influence happens through conversations, framing, and storytellingâ€”not just technical correctness.  
The job is as much relational as it is structural.

Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- What are your architectural thinking strengths?  
- Where do you want to grow?

Frame this slide as a mindset preambleâ€”before we practice architecture externally, we cultivate it internally.

Preview: Next, weâ€™ll explore how these mindsets manifest in daily practiceâ€”via kata, reflection, framing, and real-world engagement.
