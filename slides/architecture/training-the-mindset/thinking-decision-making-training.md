# 🏗️ Training Courageous Decision-Making

Architecture demands action under uncertainty—not just analysis.  
To build courage, practice making, reflecting on, and owning decisions.

<!--
Introduce this slide by framing courage as a trainable skill, not a trait you’re born with. It grows through exposure to tough decisions, intentional retrospection, and safe environments to practice action under ambiguity.

### 🧠 Decision Retrospective Replay

**Task:**  
Choose a past architectural decision with real consequences.  
Write out: context, trade-offs, ignored options, and outcome.  
Ask yourself:  
- What made this decision difficult?  
- What part required courage?  
- What would I do differently today?

**Purpose:**  
Reflects how courage felt in action—whether it showed up as a choice made *despite* fear, or a moment where fear caused delay.  
<!--
Speaker note: This helps uncover personal bias—like conflict avoidance, risk aversion, or over-analysis. Courage often shows up through discomfort. This exercise sharpens awareness of that.

### 🎭 Shadow Architect Roleplay

**Task:**  
Sit in on a team’s decision-making meeting.  
Privately document:
- What decision would *you* make?
- When would you make it?
- Why?

Afterward, compare your choices to what the team decided.  
Debrief with a peer:  
Were you too slow? Too bold?

**Purpose:**  
Builds your judgment muscle—without the pressure of being “right.”  
<!--
Speaker note: This lets you simulate decision ownership without disrupting the team. It builds your internal compass for timing, confidence, and clarity.

### 🧘‍♂️ Non-Technical Exercise: Deliberate Discomfort

**Task:**  
Pick a personal decision you've delayed (giving feedback, setting a boundary, etc.).  
Make that decision within 24 hours.  
Reflect:  
- Why did I avoid it?  
- What happened after?  

**Purpose:**  
Develops emotional tolerance for ambiguity, friction, and consequence.  
<!--
Speaker note: Courage is a whole-body act. Training it in low-stakes areas builds self-trust—so you’re more ready when the stakes are high in architecture.

> Courage is a skill.  
> **Practice the discomfort now,**  
> so you’re ready when it matters most.

<!--
Wrap by reinforcing that courage isn’t recklessness—it’s readiness.
The more you practice owning decisions under uncertainty, the more you empower others to move with confidence too.
