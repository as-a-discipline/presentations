Here’s your next slide: **“Training Systems Thinking”**, in full MARP markdown format. This slide translates systems thinking into a trainable discipline with practical exercises—both technical and observational. It frames systems thinking as a habit of mind to be nurtured through repeated, intentional practice.

# 🧠 Training Systems Thinking

<!-- 
This slide makes systems thinking tangible: not just a perspective, but a practice.  

Ask the group: Where have you seen ripple effects in your own system that weren’t obvious at design time?

Systems thinking isn’t theoretical—it’s how you see *and shape* reality.
-->

To internalize systems thinking, **practice must meet perception**:

- 🔄 Architecture Feedback Loop Mapping
<!-- 
Choose a known system and map the reinforcing or stabilizing loops within it—alerts, retries, throttles, user signals.  
What happens if a loop delays or fails?  
This builds dynamic awareness—not just structural.
-->

- 🌊 Ripple Effect Analysis
<!-- 
Start with a small change—a schema tweak, config flag, or minor refactor.  
Trace 2–3 layers of downstream impact: teams, systems, KPIs.  
What could go wrong—or create surprise leverage?
-->

- 🗺️ Constraint Cartography
<!-- 
Map all system constraints: technical, org, temporal, regulatory.  
Ask which are hard vs. assumed.  
Seeing the full terrain prevents invisible blockers from shaping your architecture unknowingly.
-->

- 🧾 Systemic Storytelling
<!-- 
Describe a well-known real-world system using *only* actors, interactions, and feedback loops.  
No components or jargon.  
Builds abstraction fluency and communication precision.
-->

- 🧍 Diagram the Office
<!-- 
Sketch how feedback, decisions, and incentives move through your team—not just your software.  
Look for bottlenecks, amplifiers, or broken loops.  
This connects systems thinking to culture and communication.
-->

> Practice builds pattern recognition. Reflection builds judgment. Systems thinking requires both.

<!-- 
Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- Which of these could you run with your team this quarter?  
- Where might systems thinking improve non-technical decisions?

Bonus: Recommend *Thinking in Systems* by Donella Meadows as foundational reading.

Preview: Next, we’ll explore how these thinking patterns translate into scenario foresight and architectural resilience.
