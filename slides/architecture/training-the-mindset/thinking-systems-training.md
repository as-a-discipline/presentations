# ðŸ§  Training Systems Thinking

<!-- 
This slide makes systems thinking tangible: not just a perspective, but a practice.  

Ask the group: Where have you seen ripple effects in your own system that werenâ€™t obvious at design time?

Systems thinking isnâ€™t theoreticalâ€”itâ€™s how you see *and shape* reality.

# ðŸ§  Training Systems Thinking

- Architecture Feedback Loop Mapping  
<!-- 
Choose a known system and map the reinforcing or stabilizing loops within itâ€”alerts, retries, throttles, user signals.  
What happens if a loop delays or fails?  
This builds dynamic awarenessâ€”not just structural.
-->

# ðŸ§  Training Systems Thinking

- Architecture Feedback Loop Mapping  
- Ripple Effect Analysis  
<!-- 
Start with a small changeâ€”a schema tweak, config flag, or minor refactor.  
Trace 2â€“3 layers of downstream impact: teams, systems, KPIs.  
What could go wrongâ€”or create surprise leverage?
-->

# ðŸ§  Training Systems Thinking

- Architecture Feedback Loop Mapping  
- Ripple Effect Analysis  
- Constraint Cartography  
<!-- 
Map all system constraints: technical, org, temporal, regulatory.  
Ask which are hard vs. assumed.  
Seeing the full terrain prevents invisible blockers from shaping your architecture unknowingly.

# ðŸ§  Training Systems Thinking

- Architecture Feedback Loop Mapping  
- Ripple Effect Analysis  
- Constraint Cartography  
- Systemic Storytelling  
<!-- 
Describe a well-known real-world system using *only* actors, interactions, and feedback loops.  
No components or jargon.  
Builds abstraction fluency and communication precision.
-->

# ðŸ§  Training Systems Thinking

- Architecture Feedback Loop Mapping  
- Ripple Effect Analysis  
- Constraint Cartography  
- Systemic Storytelling  
- Diagram the Office  
<!-- 
Sketch how feedback, decisions, and incentives move through your teamâ€”not just your software.  
Look for bottlenecks, amplifiers, or broken loops.  
This connects systems thinking to culture and communication.

> Practice builds pattern recognition. Reflection builds judgment. 
> Systems thinking requires both.

Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- Which of these could you run with your team this quarter?  
- Where might systems thinking improve non-technical decisions?
