# 🧭 Training Temporal Branching 

<!-- 
Architects must see time as a design dimension.  
These exercises train anticipatory thinking and decision timing.

# 🧭 Training Temporal Branching 

- Multi-Timeline Design Drill  
<!-- Task: Take a recent or upcoming architectural decision. Sketch three diverging timelines:  
  - What if adoption accelerates rapidly?  
  - What if usage stagnates or declines?  
  - What if external constraints change (e.g., compliance, vendor, org)?  
  Label which choices are reversible, optional, or irreversible.  
Purpose: Builds fluency in conditional reasoning and helps identify design points that constrain future choices. -->

# 🧭 Training Temporal Branching

- Multi-Timeline Design Drill  
- Delayed Commitment Map  
<!-- Task: List out 5–10 key architectural decisions currently under discussion.  
Mark which ones must be made now—and which can be safely deferred.  
For deferrable ones, define the trigger signal for when a choice becomes required.  
Purpose: Teaches intentional decision pacing, helps avoid premature commitment, and promotes just-in-time architectural clarity. -->

# 🧭 Training Temporal Branching 

- Multi-Timeline Design Drill  
- Delayed Commitment Map  
- Fictional Futures  
<!-- Task: Write a 1-page story imagining a team or company 3 years from now.  
Include how their systems evolved, what decisions helped or hurt, and what constraints emerged.  
Write one optimistic and one pessimistic version.  
Purpose: Strengthens the architect’s narrative foresight muscle—seeing not just systems, but social, cultural, and operational evolution. -->

<!-- 
Reiterate that temporal foresight isn’t about being right—it’s about being ready.  
These exercises help architects stretch beyond present certainty, building designs that invite adaptation over rigidity.

Recommended Book:
Title: The Art of the Long View by Peter Schwartz
Purpose: A foundational text on scenario planning, this book teaches strategic foresight by modeling divergent futures in business, policy, and technology.
