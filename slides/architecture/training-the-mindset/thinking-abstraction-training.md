# ðŸ§  Training Abstraction Without Detachment

<!-- 
This slide shifts from the concept of abstraction to the *practice* of doing it well. 
Use this moment to remind the audience that abstraction isn't just thinking at a higher levelâ€”it's translating complexity into shared, useful mental models.

# ðŸ§  Training Abstraction Without Detachment

- Dependency Ladder Mapping  
<!-- 
Choose a system and model it in 3 layers:  
1. Full implementation  
2. Technical overview  
3. Business/user abstraction  
â†’ Compare what each reveals and conceals.  
This helps develop fluency in shifting perspectives and testing abstraction clarity.

# ðŸ§  Training Abstraction Without Detachment

- Dependency Ladder Mapping  
- Abstraction Validation Drill  
<!-- 
Share your abstraction with a teammate.  
Ask them to explain it back to you.  
â†’ Observe confusion, assumptions, or unintended interpretations.  
This simulates real-world communication. Abstract models that donâ€™t survive feedback arenâ€™t useful.

- Dependency Ladder Mapping  
- Abstraction Validation Drill  
- Non-Technical: Map Reduction Exercise  
<!-- 
Reduce or expand a real-world map (e.g., subway, campus).  
â†’ Discuss whatâ€™s gained or lost with each layer.  
Helps develop the instinct for fidelity vs. focusâ€”when to collapse or expose information.

> The role of the architect is not to simplify reality for themselvesâ€”but to clarify complexity for others.

Wrap-up Notes:

Ask: How do we test if an abstraction *works* for the team?

Reinforce:  
Good abstraction helps others act. Bad abstraction traps them in misalignment.

Title: How to Take Smart Notes by SÃ¶nke Ahrens
Purpose: Though focused on knowledge management, this book teaches how to abstract information from various sources, synthesize it, and create new value skills directly applicable to thoughtful architectural abstraction.
