# 🏗️ Training Multi-Modal Expression 

<!-- 
Introduce this as the applied muscle of communication. 
It’s not enough to know a system—you must be able to make others *see* it. 
This is about shifting modes to shift minds. 
-->

To express architecture effectively, **practice across formats and perspectives**:

# 🏗️ Training Multi-Modal Expression 

- Dual Medium Translation  
<!--  
Explain the same system:
- In a written paragraph for execs  
- As a diagram for engineers  
- As a metaphor for non-technical teams  
→ Compare what each version reveals or hides.  
This builds fluency and format-awareness.

# 🏗️ Training Multi-Modal Expression 

- Dual Medium Translation  
- Constraint-Driven Diagramming  
<!--  
Draw the same system three ways:  
1. Only shapes and lines (no labels)  
2. Only text (no visuals)  
3. A hybrid view  

This teaches you to find *what each medium is best at*—and when you’re leaning too hard on one.

# 🏗️ Training Multi-Modal Expression 

- Dual Medium Translation  
- Constraint-Driven Diagramming  
- Concept Map Storytelling  
<!--  
Pick a non-technical system (e.g., pizza delivery, airport security).  
Create:
- A concept map  
- A short story to explain it  
→ This sharpens the ability to clarify, sequence, and teach any system.

> Communication is not the last step—it’s the **architectural interface** between vision and shared execution.

Wrap-up Speaker Notes:

Ask the group:  
- Which of these could you run as a team exercise next sprint?  
- When’s the last time you changed *how* you presented, not just *what*?

Remind: This is about empathy. You’re not designing for yourself—you’re designing through others.

Preview: Next, we’ll dive into adaptive foresight—designing across multiple futures.
