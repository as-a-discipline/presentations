# ⚖️ Training Ethical Foresight 

<!-- 
Ethical foresight helps architects assess not just what can be built, but what should be built.  
Consequential reasoning traces technical, social, and systemic impacts—especially second- and third-order effects.  
These exercises train architects to anticipate harm, weigh trade-offs, and embed accountability into design.

# ⚖️ Training Ethical Foresight 

- System Consequence Mapping  
<!-- Task: Choose a real or fictional system (e.g., facial recognition, public health dashboard, gamified education app).  
Map 3 layers of consequence:  
1. Direct effect (what it’s designed to do)  
2. Indirect effects (behavioral shifts, unintended uses)  
3. Systemic effects (bias, policy influence, dependency loops)  
Evaluate ethical tensions: equity, privacy, consent, sustainability.  
Purpose: Builds discipline in multi-layered impact analysis across users, organizations, and society. -->

# ⚖️ Training Ethical Foresight 

- System Consequence Mapping  
- Values Conflict Scenario  
<!-- Task: Construct a fictional scenario where two ethical values collide (e.g., user privacy vs. safety, transparency vs. security).  
Write a short architectural decision memo addressing:  
- The available options  
- The risks of each  
- The value trade-off you recommend and why  
Purpose: Trains principled decision-making under ethical tension—a common reality in system design. -->

# ⚖️ Training Ethical Foresight 

- System Consequence Mapping  
- Values Conflict Scenario  
- Non-Technical: Consequence Journaling  
<!-- Task: For one week, observe systems in your daily life (software, policies, infrastructure).  
Each day, journal an unintended consequence you notice.  
Reflect: Was it foreseen? Ignored? Mitigated?  
Purpose: Builds sensitivity to design impact and reinforces foresight as a continuous mindset—not just a compliance step. -->

> “Designing without foresight is like sailing without a compass. It may feel fast—but you’ll never know where you’re headed.”

<!-- 
Ethical design isn’t about perfection—it’s about responsibility.  
Remind your audience that architects shape more than systems—they shape trust, fairness, and the future.

Recommended Book:
Title: Design Justice by Sasha Costanza-Chock
Purpose: Explores how design practices can reinforce inequality and how to shift toward more inclusive, justice-oriented frameworks in technology and architecture.
