🧠 Speaker Notes:

- *Shadow the Role*  
  Pairing with someone outside your discipline helps uncover where systems are brittle, confusing, or invisible to others. You’ll often find architectural “gotchas” that only surface in real workflows.

- *Persona-Based Architecture Review*  
  Creating a few archetypes and evaluating how they perceive your architecture is a powerful empathy builder. It helps you improve clarity, spot friction, and align expectations before rollout.

- *Roleplay Walkthrough*  
  Practicing how you’d explain a diagram or decision to someone new forces you to identify complexity, jargon, and assumption gaps. It builds the muscle for inclusive communication.

- *Recommended Book: Radical Candor by Kim Scott*  
  While not architecture-specific, this book sharpens your ability to speak with honesty and care. That’s essential when discussing difficult trade-offs or pushing for high standards in cross-functional teams.
