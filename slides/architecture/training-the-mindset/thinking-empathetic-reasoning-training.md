# 💬 Training Empathetic Reasoning 

<!-- 
Empathy enables architects to anticipate how others will experience the systems they design.  
Perspective-taking means internalizing how engineers, operators, users, and decision-makers engage with a system.  
These exercises train architects to design with others' mental models in mind—not just their own.

# 💬 Training Empathetic Reasoning 

- Shadow the Role  
<!-- Task: Pair with a team member outside your discipline—support, QA, ops, PM, or customer success.  
Shadow them for 1–2 hours. Observe what systems they touch, where they struggle, and how they interpret architecture without full context.  
Reflect: What did you assume was obvious that wasn’t? Where did your design cause friction?  
Purpose: Builds real-world empathy and architectural humility. -->

- Shadow the Role  
- Persona-Based Architecture Review  
<!-- Task: Choose a system or architecture proposal.  
Create 3 personas (e.g., junior engineer, SRE, executive sponsor).  
For each, ask:  
- What do they need to understand quickly?  
- Where might confusion or misalignment occur?  
- What unintended burdens could they inherit?  
Purpose: Sharpens inclusive thinking and uncovers communication or design gaps. -->

- Non-Technical: Roleplay Walkthrough  
<!-- Task: Select a decision or architecture diagram you’ve authored.  
Roleplay explaining it to someone with less context (new hire, stakeholder, adjacent team).  
Capture where you oversimplify, stumble, or assume shared understanding.  
Purpose: Surfaces blind spots and improves your communication clarity and flexibility. -->

<!-- 
Empathetic reasoning doesn’t weaken precision—it sharpens it.  
Encourage architects to design for humans, not just machines.
