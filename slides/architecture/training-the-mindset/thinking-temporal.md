# ⏳ Temporal Branching

<!-- 
Architectural decisions are rarely one-dimensional. What seems like a small choice in the present may become a constraint, a catalyst, or a liability in the future. 
This section builds the mental model of scenario foresight—enabling architects to design not just for now, but for many possible futures.

# ⏳ Temporal Branching

- Architecture exists in motion, not in snapshots  
<!-- Speaker note: Introduce the idea that architecture must operate across time—not just space. We don’t control the future, but we can design for its uncertainty. -->

# ⏳ Temporal Branching

- Each design has converging and diverging paths  
- Future paths include accelerations, stall-outs, reversals  
<!-- Speaker note: Encourage students to imagine non-linear evolution. A choice might lead to unexpected complexity or surprising success—it’s not just forward vs. backward. -->

# ⏳ Temporal Branching

- Today’s anomalies may become tomorrow’s norms  
- Risky configs, unsupported integrations, niche use cases  
- All are potential signals of what’s next  
<!-- Speaker note: Give examples—dark launches becoming default, cloud-native assumptions taking over, API edge behaviors forming core business flows. -->

# ⏳ Temporal Branching

- Many architectural mistakes aren’t wrong—they’re premature  
- Delay irreversible choices until sufficient context  
- Optionality preserves adaptability  
> “Architecture exists in motion—not in snapshots.”

<!-- 
Close by reinforcing that temporal awareness is a mindset.  
Architects who map possibility rather than predict correctness enable systems that adapt over time—reducing technical debt and increasing strategic leverage.
