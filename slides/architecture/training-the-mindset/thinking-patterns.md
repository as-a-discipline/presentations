# ðŸ§© Pattern Recognition

<!-- 
This slide positions pattern recognition as more than memorizationâ€”itâ€™s the ability to see structure, avoid traps, and evolve knowledge.  

Ask the group: Whatâ€™s a pattern you used recentlyâ€”did it help or hinder?

Architecture isnâ€™t just what you buildâ€”itâ€™s how you *see*.

- More than memoryâ€”it's matching and meaning  
<!-- 
Architects draw from lived experience and conceptual models.  
They match new problems to known archetypes or past decisionsâ€”efficiently, but not lazily.  
Pattern recognition acceleratesâ€”but must remain thoughtful.

- More than memoryâ€”it's matching and meaning  
- Avoid cargo cult architecture  
<!-- 
Copy-pasting patterns without context leads to brittle, misaligned systems.  
Patterns guideâ€”they donâ€™t absolve judgment.  
A good architect knows *when not* to use a pattern.

- Avoid cargo cult architecture  
- Discover new patterns through synthesis  
<!-- 
Not all patterns are known.  
Architects observe across domains, connect the dots, and name emerging forms.  
The best patterns often start as hacks or edge cases.

- Use the 0, 1, âˆž principle wisely  
<!-- 
Designing for unbounded use is powerfulâ€”but can overgeneralize.  
Ask: Do I *need* scale hereâ€”or am I optimizing too early?  
Use pattern tension to decide where to collapse complexity.

<!-- 
Update, revise, and reframe old patterns.  
What worked last year may not fit todayâ€™s constraints or scale.  
Pattern fluency grows from reflection, not repetition.

> Pattern recognition isn't about remembering the pastâ€”it's about *reading the present* and *anticipating the future*.

<!-- 
Ask the group:  
- What pattern do you lean on mostâ€”and where has it failed you?  
- Whatâ€™s a pattern youâ€™ve discovered, but havenâ€™t named yet?

Remind: The best architects arenâ€™t just users of patternsâ€”they are *authors* of them.
