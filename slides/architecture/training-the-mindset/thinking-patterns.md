# 🧩 Pattern Recognition

<!-- 
This slide positions pattern recognition as more than memorization—it’s the ability to see structure, avoid traps, and evolve knowledge.  

Ask the group: What’s a pattern you used recently—did it help or hinder?

Architecture isn’t just what you build—it’s how you *see*.
-->

Pattern recognition enables **strategic reuse and structural insight**:

- 🧠 More than memory—it's matching and meaning
<!-- 
Architects draw from lived experience and conceptual models.  
They match new problems to known archetypes or past decisions—efficiently, but not lazily.  
Pattern recognition accelerates—but must remain thoughtful.
-->

- 🚫 Avoid cargo cult architecture
<!-- 
Copy-pasting patterns without context leads to brittle, misaligned systems.  
Patterns guide—they don’t absolve judgment.  
A good architect knows *when not* to use a pattern.
-->

- 🧪 Discover new patterns through synthesis
<!-- 
Not all patterns are known.  
Architects observe across domains, connect the dots, and name emerging forms.  
The best patterns often start as hacks or edge cases.
-->

- ∞ Use the 0, 1, ∞ principle wisely
<!-- 
Designing for unbounded use is powerful—but can overgeneralize.  
Ask: Do I *need* scale here—or am I optimizing too early?  
Use pattern tension to decide where to collapse complexity.
-->

- 📚 Keep your pattern library living
<!-- 
Update, revise, and reframe old patterns.  
What worked last year may not fit today’s constraints or scale.  
Pattern fluency grows from reflection, not repetition.
-->

> Pattern recognition isn't about remembering the past—it's about *reading the present* and *anticipating the future*.

<!-- 
Wrap-up Notes:

Ask the group:  
- What pattern do you lean on most—and where has it failed you?  
- What’s a pattern you’ve discovered, but haven’t named yet?

Remind: The best architects aren’t just users of patterns—they are *authors* of them.

Preview: Next we’ll explore abstraction—how to simplify without detaching—and why it’s critical to pattern application.
