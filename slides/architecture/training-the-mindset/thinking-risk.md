# 🛡️ Risk Mindset & Threat Modeling

<!--
Risk isn’t the enemy. Ignorance of risk is.  
Architects must cultivate a mindset that frames risk as navigable, not paralyzing.

Open by shifting the audience’s default posture. Most people treat risk as something to avoid—this slide reframes it as something to understand and work with.

<!-- 
You must surface uncomfortable truths without fearmongering.  
Your tone and framing matter—calm, factual articulation earns trust and inspires action.

> Resilience starts with realism.  
> Risk-aware architecture embraces fragility as a signal—not a secret.
