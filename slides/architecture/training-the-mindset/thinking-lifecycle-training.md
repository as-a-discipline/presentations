# ♻️ Training Lifecycle Thinking

<!-- 
Architects must see beyond delivery.  
Lifecycle thinking sharpens system empathy, reduces long-term risk, and connects technical decisions to real-world evolution.

# ♻️ Training Lifecycle Thinking

- Lifecycle Mapping Drill  
<!-- Task: Choose a system or feature and map its full lifecycle:  
  - Inception, Build, Operations, Evolution, and Sunset  
For each phase, identify:  
  - Key priorities, phase-specific risks, and adaptive vs. persistent components  
Purpose: Reinforces that architecture is never “done”—only stewarded through change. -->

# ♻️ Training Lifecycle Thinking

- Lifecycle Mapping Drill  
- Right-Sized Architecture Scenario  
<!-- Task: Given three project types (e.g., MVP, long-term platform, uncertain tool),  
define the appropriate level of architectural investment for each.  
Note what lifecycle phase you're optimizing for, and how you'd document intentional minimalism vs. durability.  
Purpose: Trains judgment and avoids both over- and under-engineering by aligning design depth to lifecycle maturity. -->

# ♻️ Training Lifecycle Thinking

- Lifecycle Mapping Drill  
- Right-Sized Architecture Scenario  
- Architecture Graveyard Retrospective  
<!-- Task: Pick a real or well-known deprecated system.  
Ask: What lifecycle stage was ignored?  
What early choices made later adaptation difficult?  
What would graceful decline have looked like?  
Purpose: Promotes humility, reflection, and learning from endings—not just launches. -->

# ♻️ Training Lifecycle Thinking

- Lifecycle Mapping Drill  
- Right-Sized Architecture Scenario  
- Architecture Graveyard Retrospective  
- Non-Technical: Product Lifelines  
<!-- Task: Sketch the lifecycle of a well-known product (e.g., Google+, Windows XP).  
Map when its technology aligned—or conflicted—with its business needs.  
Ask: What architectural foresight might have prolonged usefulness or improved decommissioning?  
Purpose: Builds long-range strategic thinking that links technical choices to market and user realities. -->

<!--  
Lifecycle thinking cultivates engineering maturity.  
Great architects leave behind systems that grow—and end—with integrity.
