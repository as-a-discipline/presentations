# 🧭 Training Lifecycle Thinking

Train for change, not just creation.  
Steward systems across their full lifespan.

### 🗺️ Lifecycle Mapping Drill

- **Exercise:** Pick a system. Map its phases: Inception → Rollout → Operation → Evolution → Decline.
- **Reflection:** For each stage, identify priorities, risks, and what must evolve or endure.
**🧠 Speaker Note:** Most systems fail not in design, but in transition. Mapping lifecycle stages helps teams prepare for change instead of react to it.

### 🧮 Right-Sized Architecture Scenario

- **Exercise:** Evaluate three systems with different lifespans (MVP, long-term core, modular tool).
- **Output:** Define the *appropriate* investment level and design posture for each.
**🧠 Speaker Note:** Architectural maturity isn’t maximalism—it’s proportionality. This drill sharpens judgment around when to build big, when to stay lean, and when to leave doors open.

### 🪦 Architecture Graveyard Retrospective

- **Exercise:** Review a deprecated system—real or researched.
- **Analysis:** What design decisions sped up its decay? What lifecycle phase was neglected?
**🧠 Speaker Note:** Every system ends. Studying failure teaches us how to design for graceful decline—and how to avoid architectures that outlive their welcome.

### 🧬 Non-Technical: Product Lifelines

- **Exercise:** Trace a famous product’s rise and fall (e.g., Google+, Windows XP).
- **Insight:** Note how its tech either enabled or resisted business shifts.
**🧠 Speaker Note:** This broadens your pattern recognition. Tech health and business success are interdependent—architects must learn to see both timelines clearly.

<!--
🧠 Speaker Wrap-Up Notes:
Close with a reminder: Architecture that lasts isn’t just robust—it’s adaptable. Our goal is to design systems that evolve cleanly, retire gracefully, and serve the business across multiple phases of life. That’s not just good design—it’s responsible stewardship.
