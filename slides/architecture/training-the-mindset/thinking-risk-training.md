# 🧠 Training Risk Awareness & Threat Modeling

Architects don’t eliminate risk—they learn to navigate it.  
These exercises train your eye for failure modes, misuse, and fragility before they become reality.

### 🧩 Threat Model the Mundane

- **Choose a simple, non-sensitive system.**
E.g., to-do list app, calendar integration, conference tool.
**🧠 Speaker Note:** Start with systems that feel “safe” to practice without emotional baggage or real-world consequence.

- **Identify 3+ threat types:**  
  - Technical (e.g., data loss)  
  - Behavioral (e.g., user misuse)  
  - Contextual (e.g., bad integrations)
**🧠 Speaker Note:** Make risk multi-dimensional—this builds pattern awareness beyond code.

- **Create a basic STRIDE model.**  
Even when security isn’t the focus.
**🧠 Speaker Note:** STRIDE isn’t just for pen-testers. It’s a thinking tool—use it to surface where assumptions break down.

### 🧨 Failure Premortem Exercise

- **Imagine total system failure—1 year after launch.**
Write the postmortem in advance.
**🧠 Speaker Note:** Treat this like storytelling. Force your brain to fill in the gaps—what broke, why, and how it was missed?

- **Trace back overlooked signals and risky assumptions.**
What could you address now?
**🧠 Speaker Note:** This flips the bias toward optimism. Good architecture includes rehearsing regret before it happens.

### 🧠 Non-Technical: Red Team a Decision

- **Pick a recent or upcoming non-technical decision.**
Something with consequences: personal, team-related, financial.
**🧠 Speaker Note:** You’ll see how hard it is to accept critique—and how useful it becomes when emotions are set aside.

- **Invite a colleague to red team it—play devil’s advocate.**
Then steelman their critique (don’t defend—improve it).
**🧠 Speaker Note:** This trains emotional detachment from your choices and builds decision quality under fire.

📚 **Recommended Book:**  
**_Thinking in Bets_ by Annie Duke**  
> Reframes decisions as probabilistic bets—not certainties. Ideal for learning how to manage risk over time.

<!--
Close the session by reminding the audience: resilient architecture doesn’t emerge from optimism. It emerges from rehearsed discomfort and principled paranoia.
