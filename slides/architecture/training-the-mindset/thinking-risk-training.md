# 🛡️ Training Risk Awareness & Threat Modeling

<!-- 
A risk-aware architect sees both what can go wrong and what must go right.  
Training this mindset means learning to anticipate failure modes, question optimistic assumptions,  
and surface structural vulnerabilities without falling into paralysis or fear.  
Threat modeling is not just a security practice; it’s a way of thinking about architecture  
as a set of trade-offs and exposures.

# 🛡️ Training Risk Awareness & Threat Modeling

- Threat Model the Mundane
<!--
- Choose a familiar, non-sensitive system.  
- Identify at least 3 threat types:  
  - Technical (e.g., data loss)  
  - Behavioral (e.g., misuse)  
  - Contextual (e.g., bad integrations)  
- Create a simple STRIDE model.  
-->
<!-- 
Purpose: Builds pattern recognition for hidden risks and broadens the lens beyond security  
to include architectural, operational, and business threats.

# 🛡️ Training Risk Awareness & Threat Modeling

- Threat Model the Mundane
- Failure Premortem Exercise
<!-- 
- Imagine your system fails catastrophically one year after launch.  
- Write a detailed story:  
  - What failed?  
  - What was overlooked?  
  - What signals were ignored?  
- Reverse-engineer preventative actions for today.  
-->
<!-- 
Purpose: Encourages proactive identification of systemic weaknesses and cultural blind spots.  
Shifts risk thinking from reaction to anticipation.

> Resilience isn’t optimism—it’s practiced paranoia.  
> **Great architects don’t just model success—they rehearse failure.**

<!-- 
Close by reinforcing that risk is the terrain, not the exception.  
Navigating that terrain with clarity, humility, and confidence is what sets architects apart.

Title: Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke
Purpose: Reframes decisions as probabilistic bets rather than binary choices ideal for improving judgment under uncertainty and managing risk over time.
