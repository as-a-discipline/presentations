# 🌊 Systems Thinking for Architects

Architecture lives within **dynamic, interdependent systems**:

<!-- 
This slide expands architectural scope from components to dynamics—how systems behave, evolve, and respond.  

Ask the group: Have you ever fixed one thing… only to break something else?

Systems thinking helps us anticipate consequences, not just define components.

Architecture lives within **dynamic, interdependent systems**:

- Feedback loops drive system behavior
<!-- 
Positive loops amplify change. Negative loops dampen it.  
Architects must spot these cycles—like compounding tech debt or brittle onboarding practices.  
Ask: What behaviors are we accidentally reinforcing?

# 🌊 Systems Thinking for Architects

Architecture lives within **dynamic, interdependent systems**:

- Feedback loops drive system behavior
- Emergence reveals what design can’t predict
<!-- 
Some behaviors only appear at scale or under pressure.  
Performance bottlenecks, resilience issues, or team misalignment can *emerge*—even if each part looks fine.  
Design for observation, not just construction.

Architecture lives within **dynamic, interdependent systems**:

- Feedback loops drive system behavior
- Emergence reveals what design can’t predict
- Delays and oscillations distort causality
<!-- 
Lag between action and impact creates instability.  
Slow feedback (monitoring, retries, user lag) can cause cascading or compounding problems.  
Anticipate where cause and effect aren’t linear.

Architecture lives within **dynamic, interdependent systems**:

- Feedback loops drive system behavior
- Emergence reveals what design can’t predict
- Delays and oscillations distort causality
- Boundaries define integrity and ownership
<!-- 
What’s inside your system? What’s not?  
Clear boundaries prevent brittle integrations and reduce surprise.  
System fragility often hides at interfaces.

Architecture lives within **dynamic, interdependent systems**:

- Feedback loops drive system behavior
- Emergence reveals what design can’t predict
- Delays and oscillations distort causality
- Boundaries define integrity and ownership
- System archetypes repeat across domains
<!-- 
Patterns like “Fixes That Backfire” or “Limits to Growth” are not just theory—they’re warnings.  
Use them to frame org dynamics and architectural risks alike.  
Systems often behave *predictably*—once you learn their patterns.

> Great architecture doesn’t control complexity—it coexists with it, gracefully.

Wrap-up Notes:

End with the shift in posture: from architect-as-controller to architect-as-influencer.  
You can’t force systems—but you can shape them through structure, observation, and feedback.

Ask the group:  
- Where in your system do you see feedback loops?  
- What boundaries are unclear—and causing pain?

Preview: Next we’ll explore tools for *framing* this complexity into meaningful architectural decisions.
