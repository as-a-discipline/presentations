title: Thinking Like an Architect - The Architect's Opening Moves
description: |
  This session explores the mindset and early moves of a software architect. Rather than jumping into technology or tooling, 
  good architecture starts with context, ambiguity, and thoughtful framing. Participants will learn how to approach architectural 
  problems by clarifying uncertainty, uncovering complexity, and reframing the problem before proposing a solution. These skills are 
  essential to building resilient, adaptable systems.
