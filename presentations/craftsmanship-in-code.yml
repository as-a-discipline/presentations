title: Craftsmanship in Code - Patterns for Sustainable Software
description: |
  Creating durable and maintainable software requires more than just clean code—it demands strategic architecture and 
  design patterns that stand the test of time. In this session, we'll explore the role of the Anti-Corruption Layer in 
  preserving system integrity and maintaining separation between legacy systems and new architectures. We'll dive deep 
  into patterns for reuse, focusing on how to architect for flexibility across different programming languages, including Go, C#, and Python.
