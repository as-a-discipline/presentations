title: Architecture as a Discipline - What is Architecture?
description: |
   This session introduces the concept of software architectureâ€”not as abstract diagrams or job titles, 
   but as the strategic discipline of structuring systems to endure, evolve, and scale. We'll clarify what architecture is (and isn't), 
   how it differs from design and implementation, and why it plays a foundational role in business agility, system resilience, and team alignment. 
   By the end of this session, participants will understand architecture as a set of decisions that shape the long-term trajectory of both technology and the organization.
