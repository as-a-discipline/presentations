title: Architecture as a Discipline - The Role of the Architect
description: |
  The Role of the Architect explores what it truly means to be a software architect in a modern, adaptive organization. 
  This session defines the architect not by title, but by function—guiding critical decisions, enabling delivery, mentoring teams, 
  and stewarding systems over time. Participants will gain a clear understanding of how architects influence without authority, balance strategic 
  foresight with pragmatic execution, and elevate team capabilities through clarity, consistency, and care. The talk breaks down the four key functions 
  of architecture—decision-making, facilitation, education, and risk mitigation—and highlights common anti-patterns to avoid.
