title: Architecture as a Discipline - What is Architecture?
description: |
  Becoming a software architect is not a linear promotion—it's a transformation in how you think, communicate, and lead. 
  This session explores the shift from engineer to architect by examining the mental models, mindset shifts, and core behaviors 
  that define effective architecture practice. You'll learn how to recognize when you've crossed the architectural inflection point, 
  how to expand your lens from code to context, and how to grow your influence without formal authority. We'll cover actionable steps for 
  building architectural skills and avoiding common pitfalls—equipping you to lead systems, not just features. This is the foundational 
  session for any engineer looking to grow into architecture with confidence and clarity.
