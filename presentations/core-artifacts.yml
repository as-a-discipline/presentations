title: Core Artifacts
description: |
  This presentation introduces the foundational artifacts every software architect should produce. 
  Each artifact represents a unique lens through which architectural intent, context, and constraints are expressed 
  and evolved. You'll learn what these artifacts are, when to create them, and how they align to business goals, 
  technical risks, and team collaboration. Each artifact will be introduced with its purpose, audience, timing, and a simple example.
