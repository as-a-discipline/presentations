# Thinking Like an Architect

## The Architect’s Opening Moves

Architecture doesn’t begin with diagrams or decisions—it begins with perception, framing, and learning. These are the opening moves of great architects:

---

## Understanding the Context

<!-- _class: lead -->

Before building anything, architects must deeply understand the *why*:

* What business or operational outcome is driving this?
* What problem are we solving, and for whom?
* What constraints are imposed by budget, time, or regulation?

Architecture that aligns to context increases value and decreases risk. Misunderstanding the purpose leads to misaligned solutions.

---

## Find the Core Use Case and Derive the Rest

Every architecture should trace back to a *core use case*:

* Identify the primary job-to-be-done
* Understand the essential flow or interaction
* Derive secondary and edge cases from the core pattern

This creates focus. You build what matters first—and simplify the rest.

---

## 1. Disambiguate and Classify Uncertainty

<!-- _class: lead -->

Before you can design, you must understand what you’re solving. Architects begin by surfacing ambiguity:

* What is known?
* What is assumed?
* What is unknown?

Clarifying these reveals hidden risks and helps prevent premature commitment to solutions.

This classification also makes requirements review actionable, allowing architects to map facts to needs and begin meaningful conversations.

---

## 2. Uncover Hidden Complexity

Great architecture anticipates complexity—especially the kind that isn’t obvious:

* **Structural complexity**: How many systems or domains are involved?
* **Organizational complexity**: Who owns which parts of the process or system?
* **Temporal complexity**: How will this change over time or with scale?

Uncovering these early prevents rework later. It ensures the system will remain operable, observable, and adaptable.

---

## 3. Apply and Assign Mental Models

Architects don’t just see problems—they model them.

* Apply known frameworks or analogies to structure reasoning
* Assign models to stakeholders and subsystems
* Use mental models to spot misalignments or missing perspectives

This shift from surface detail to abstract reasoning allows patterns to emerge and opens up solution paths.

---

## 4. Model the System and Situate the Architecture Within It

Architecture is part of a system—not separate from it.

* Map feedback loops, boundaries, and stakeholders
* Understand constraints from the environment
* Define how your architecture will interact with the larger system

This step prevents siloed solutions and supports integration and scalability.

---

## 5. Apply Heuristics

With context modeled and ambiguity reduced, architects reach for heuristics:

* “Prefer composition over inheritance”
* “Minimize the cost of change”
* “Design for the expected case, isolate the exceptional”

Heuristics offer fast, grounded guidance in uncertain situations and help avoid analysis paralysis.

---

## 6. Reframe the Problem with New Understanding

By now, the original request may seem incomplete or misframed. That’s the point:

* Revisit the question: “What are we *really* solving?”
* Reframe in terms of outcomes, not inputs
* Align constraints with capabilities

Good architects evolve the problem before evolving the solution.

---

## 7. Tell the Story

Once a direction is clear, it must be communicated:

* Show how decisions align with context
* Tailor the narrative to technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Use narrative and visuals to convey rationale, risk, and impact

Storytelling makes architecture real. It fosters alignment, trust, and shared direction.

---

## Communicating Architecture Across the Organization

Architecture must live beyond the diagram—it must be adopted:

* Run roadshows or deep dives for engineering, product, and ops
* Customize messages: strategy for execs, detail for engineers, impact for operations
* Encourage feedback and refine iteratively

If no one adopts it, it’s not architecture—it’s just a drawing.

---

## Capturing Feedback – Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Good architecture evolves with input. Capture it:

* Use ADRs to record decisions, context, and rationale
* Make trade-offs and assumptions explicit
* Encourage discussion and challenge

ADRs create a history of learning—not just decisions.

---

## Summary: Thinking Before Designing

These seven moves don’t require tools or titles. They require:

* Observation
* Clarity
* Judgment
* Communication

They turn architectural thinking into architectural action—before a single diagram is drawn.

“Architecture starts before the architecture.”
