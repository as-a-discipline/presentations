title: Architecture as a Discipline - The Boundaries of Architecture
description: |
  The Boundaries of Architecture defines where architecture begins, where it ends, and why those boundaries matter. 
  This session helps architects and engineering leaders avoid the common pitfalls of overreach—where architecture becomes a bottleneck—and 
  underreach—where architecture becomes irrelevant. Through clear examples, it outlines what responsibilities belong to architecture, what should be left to teams, 
  and how to strike the right balance. Participants will learn how to create architectural guardrails that empower rather than constrain, how to use decision records 
  and coaching to scale architectural thinking, and how to spot anti-patterns like the "Architect-as-Overlord" or the "Absent Architect." The goal is to create clarity,
  trust, and flow—so teams can move fast without creating long-term risk.
