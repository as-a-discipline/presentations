## Craftsmanship in Code: Patterns for Sustainable Software

Creating durable and maintainable software requires more than just clean code—it demands strategic architecture and design patterns that stand the test of time. In this session, we’ll explore the role of the Anti-Corruption Layer in preserving system integrity and maintaining separation between legacy systems and new architectures. We’ll dive deep into patterns for reuse, focusing on how to architect for flexibility across different programming languages, including Go, C#, and Python.


We’ll also discuss advanced techniques like code generation and abstraction patterns that allow developers to focus on the parts of the code that matter while maintaining consistency and scalability. You’ll learn how to design for change, reduce technical debt, and create sustainable software architectures that adapt to evolving requirements. In this session we will share real-world examples and practical insights that demonstrate how craftsmanship in code is achievable across diverse technology stacks.
