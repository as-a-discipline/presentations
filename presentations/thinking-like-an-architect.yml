title: Architecture as a Discipline - The Role of the Architect
description: |
  This session explores the mental models and practices that define effective architectural thinking. Participants will learn how 
  architects reason across systems, time, and teamsâ€”balancing technical depth with strategic foresight. We'll break down how architects 
  frame trade-offs, navigate ambiguity, and focus on long-term impact over short-term expediency. This mindset shift is critical for 
  transitioning from technical contributor to architectural leader.
